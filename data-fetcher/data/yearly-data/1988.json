The novels won the Seiun Award for the best long-form Japanese science fiction in 1988. At the start of its production the anime was distributed through a subscription system in which episodes were mailed to existing fans of the novels. It was made in four separate tranches over nearly a decade, with the production of side-stories continuing for several further years. The main series has the largest voice cast of any anime, with well over 300 voice actors, and it is the longest OVA series ever made.

Bioroids run and control all of the administrative functions of Olympus, ensuring that the city remains the utopian society it was meant to be for all of its citizens. But for some people living in Utopia, the city has become less of a home and more of a cage.\n\nPolice officer Calon Mautholos has grown to despise Olympus following his wife's suicide, blaming her death on the lack of creative freedom caused by the rules binding the citizens of the city. As his hatred for the city grows, Calon conspires with the terrorist A.J. Sebastian to destroy the Legislature of the Central Management Bureau to send the rules of Olympus that killed his wife tumbling down. But when Calon discovers it is not political malcontent, but rather hatred for bioroids that motives Sebastian, Calon turns renegade and gains the attention of city officials. Deunan Knute and her partner Briareos of the ESWAT counter-terrorism unit are dispatched to hunt down and stop Calon and Sebastian... by any means necessary!","background":"The OVA has an almost completely original storyline, only sharing some of the characters and the setting with the source material.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1471,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1471/City_Hunter_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1272/138953l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"City Hunter 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"シティーハンター2"},{"type":"French","title":"Nicky Larson Saison 2"}],"title":"City Hunter 2","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"シティーハンター2","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":63,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1988-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1989-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":4,"year":1988},"to":{"day":14,"month":7,"year":1989}},"string":"Apr 2, 1988 to Jul 14, 1989"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.06,"scored_by":10871,"rank":529,"popularity":4190,"members":26201,"favorites":159,"synopsis":"Ryo Saeba is a private detective, but has another face as a sweeper who cleans the city of evil.

An explosion caused by a young boy with psychic powers tears through the city of Tokyo and ignites the fuse that leads to World War III. In order to prevent any further destruction, he is captured and taken into custody, never to be heard from again. Now, in the year 2019, a restored version of the city known as Neo-Tokyo—an area rife with gang violence and terrorism against the current government—stands in its place. Here, Shoutarou Kaneda leads \"the Capsules,\" a group of misfits known for riding large, custom motorcycles and being in constant conflict with their rivals \"the Clowns.\"\n\nDuring one of these battles, Shoutarou's best friend Tetsuo Shima is caught up in an accident with an esper who finds himself in the streets of Tokyo after escaping confinement from a government institution. Through this encounter, Tetsuo begins to develop his own mysterious abilities, as the government seeks to quarantine this latest psychic in a desperate attempt to prevent him from unleashing the destructive power that could once again bring the city to its knees.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Akira won the Silver Scream Award, the audience award of the Amsterdam-based Imagine Film Festival, in 1992 and was nominated for the American Anime Awards' Best Anime Feature award in 2007.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":2518,"type":"anime","name":"Streamline Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2518/Streamline_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":65,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Movie Shinsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/65/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":892,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/892/Dragon_Ball_Movie_3__Makafushigi_Daibouken","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/90341l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"HmmymYhQXwI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmymYhQXwI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmmymYhQXwI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HmmymYhQXwI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HmmymYhQXwI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HmmymYhQXwI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HmmymYhQXwI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HmmymYhQXwI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dragon Ball Movie 3: Makafushigi Daibouken"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ドラゴンボール 摩訶不思議大冒険"},{"type":"English","title":"Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure"},{"type":"German","title":"Dragon Ball Film 3: Son Gokus Erster Turnier"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Dragon Ball Película 3: Gran Aventura Mística"},{"type":"French","title":"Dragon Ball Film 3: Le Château du démon"}],"title":"Dragon Ball Movie 3: Makafushigi Daibouken","title_english":"Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure","title_japanese":"ドラゴンボール 摩訶不思議大冒険","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1988-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":7,"year":1988},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 9, 1988"},"duration":"45 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.82,"scored_by":30483,"rank":4925,"popularity":2815,"members":56793,"favorites":21,"synopsis":"Emperor Chiaotzu's wife has gone missing, and he is told by Master Shen that if he collects the seven dragon balls he can call upon the eternal dragon and wish for her return.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.\n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":85,"type":"anime","name":"Konami","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/85/Konami"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4521,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4521/Watt_Poe_to_Bokura_no_Ohanashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/52595l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Watt Poe to Bokura no Ohanashi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Wat Bo"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Legend of Watt Poe"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ワット・ボーとぼくらのお話"},{"type":"English","title":"Watt Poe"}],"title":"Watt Poe to Bokura no Ohanashi","title_english":"Watt Poe","title_japanese":"ワット・ボーとぼくらのお話","title_synonyms":["Wat Bo","Legend of Watt Poe"],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1988-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":8,"year":1988},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 12, 1988"},"duration":"54 min","rating":"PG - Children","score":6.05,"scored_by":297,"rank":9034,"popularity":13492,"members":855,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Jam lives in a small coastal village that lives off fish that men bring home every day.
