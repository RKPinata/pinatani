Once again, it's a race against time to put a stop to Diablomon's plot... but even that is cloaked in shadow.\n\nWill the revival of Omegamon be enough to stop Diablomon a second time, or will the millions of copies prove enough of a power boost to shrug off the \"Digimon Champion of Justice\"? Of course, he hasn't seen the new breed of Chosen, nor the new techniques. It's a fight to the finish, with the destruction of Tokyo resting on the line. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":230,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1323,"type":"anime","name":"Saban Brands","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1323/Saban_Brands"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":2385,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2385/One_Piece__Jango_no_Dance_Carnival","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1726/113142l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece: Jango no Dance Carnival"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ワンピース ジャンゴのダンスカーニバル"},{"type":"English","title":"One Piece: Django's Dance Carnival"}],"title":"One Piece: Jango no Dance Carnival","title_english":"One Piece: Django's Dance Carnival","title_japanese":"ワンピース ジャンゴのダンスカーニバル","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":3,"year":2001},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 3, 2001"},"duration":"6 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.13,"scored_by":22772,"rank":3518,"popularity":3321,"members":41778,"favorites":29,"synopsis":"Mirror Ball Island is throwing the largest dance festival in the East Blue.

His heart was immediately captured by the gorgeous Ranmaru Samejima, a young kendo prodigy, and the two slowly formed a deep romantic bond. Now adults and living happily together as a couple, things seem to be going well for Ranmaru and Kei.\n\nOne morning, host Kei arrives home after a night out drinking with a client. A frequent occurrence, Ranmaru is initially unfazed by Kei's drunken state—until he notices three extremely suspicious things: Kei's clothing smells of makeup, his chest is stained with lipstick, and he is carrying matches branded with the name of a love hotel. To top it all off, a woman calls the apartment asking for \"Kei-chan,\" and at that, Ranmaru loses it.\n\nHurt by Kei's unfaithful actions, Ranmaru storms off.

Initially thinking the email is nonsense, she changes her mind when it begins playing a song that she recognizes from her youth.\n\nUpon first meeting each other in person, the two are suddenly ambushed by gun-wielding men. While Mireille is capable of fending off the assault, she discovers that Kirika is quite adept in combat situations after she takes out several gunmen on her own. Despite her proficiency at killing, Kirika laments her inability to feel remorse for her victims. In addition, Kirika apparently has no memory of how she came to acquire the skills she possesses or even of her real identity.\n\nSensing shared history between them, Mireille agrees to team up with Kirika, and together, they embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of their pasts.

The life form takes the name Hikaru and turns into an identical twin of Tsubasa. As time passes, Tsubasa becomes more open to everyone around her, thanks to her new twin sister Hikaru. However, with Maguar eggs scattered all over Hokkaido, their ability to form Figure 17 is needed to eliminate all hatched Maguars until backup from D.D.'s home planet arrives on Earth.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":135,"type":"anime","name":"MediaNet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/135/MediaNet"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1005,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1005/Star_Ocean_EX","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1515/94058l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Star Ocean EX"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スターオーシャンEX"},{"type":"English","title":"Star Ocean EX"}],"title":"Star Ocean EX","title_english":"Star Ocean EX","title_japanese":"スターオーシャンEX","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2001-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":4,"year":2001},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2001}},"string":"Apr 3, 2001 to Sep 25, 2001"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.59,"scored_by":5938,"rank":6104,"popularity":5573,"members":13000,"favorites":30,"synopsis":"Claude C.

The movie's final budget was $137 million dollar budget, due to the high costs of the technology being used for the film's computer animation. With marketing costs included, The Spirits Within lost in excess of $94 million. Adjusted for 2016 inflation, this amounts to over $126 million. Not only did this directly lead to the closing of Square Pictures, but it also delayed the parent company Square from completing its planned merger with the video game publishing company Enix.

The first included a bonus CD with an original audio drama titled Inuyasha - Toki wo Koeru Mou Hitotsu no Omoi, while the second was a standard edition single disc.

Although part of the Dobias, the Geisters have recently accepted a soldier of Shioru descent onto the team, and her take-charge personality leaves the other members unsure about her loyalty and usefulness to the group. With Dobias and Shioru tensions heating up on the political floor, Creatures running rampant, and a dangerous new weapon being developed in secret, the Geisters must maintain peace among themselves and the rest of society.\n\n(Source: Anime Crash)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":100,"type":"anime","name":"TV Osaka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/100/TV_Osaka"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":107,"type":"anime","name":"Plum","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/107/Plum"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2990,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2990/Mini_Skirt_Gakuen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/113116l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mini Skirt Gakuen"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mini Skirt Jogakuen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ミニスカ学園"},{"type":"English","title":"Girl's Locker Room Lust"}],"title":"Mini Skirt Gakuen","title_english":"Girl's Locker Room Lust","title_japanese":"ミニスカ学園","title_synonyms":["Mini Skirt Jogakuen"],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":12,"year":2001},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 21, 2001"},"duration":"19 min","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":4.27,"scored_by":656,"rank":null,"popularity":11293,"members":1742,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Under the uniforms of this girls volleyball team is ripe juicy fruit ready to be picked, and they're ready to get into the action.
