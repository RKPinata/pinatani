When Zeon launches an attack on the colony holding the Gundam, a 15-year-old civilian named Amuro Ray suddenly finds himself thrown into a conflict that will take him all across Earth and space, pitting him against the enemy's ace pilot, Char Aznable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Kidou Senshi Gundam was not popular when it first aired, and came close to being cancelled. The series was originally set to run for 52 episodes but was cut down to 39 by the show's sponsors, but the staff was able to negotiate an extension to end the series with 43 episodes. When Bandai bought the copyrights to build plastic models for the show's mecha things changed and the show became popular. It revolutionized the genre by portraying mecha as piloted military weaponry with real-world scientific basis instead of superheroes' giant robots. Often referred to as the 'real robot' genre, it became the norm for mecha anime in the following years after its release. The series was the first winner of the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, in 1979 and the first half of 1980.","season":"spring","year":1979,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2471,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2471/Doraemon_1979","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/3953l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Doraemon (1979)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ドラえもん"},{"type":"English","title":"Doraemon"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Doraemon"}],"title":"Doraemon (1979)","title_english":"Doraemon","title_japanese":"ドラえもん","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":1787,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1979-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":4,"year":1979},"to":{"day":18,"month":3,"year":2005}},"string":"Apr 2, 1979 to Mar 18, 2005"},"duration":"11 min per ep","rating":"PG - Children","score":7.81,"scored_by":36608,"rank":926,"popularity":2701,"members":61106,"favorites":604,"synopsis":"Nobita Nobi is a normal fourth grade student.

Therefore, they have sent Doraemon to serve as a guide and mentor to Nobita, so that their future may change for the better.

Due to significant changes made to adapt the story into a two-hour movie and the use of a different soundtrack, the result was not well-received by fans. To promote the film, a \"Conan Festival\" was held at Nippon Budokan on July 20, 1979. Nippon Broadcasting System ran a four-hour live broadcast during its All Night Nippon program on August 31, 1979, featuring a live radio drama of the film with a newly written script. The voice actors also made guest appearances and interacted with fans by phone. On August 8, 2012, Mirai Shounen Conan (Movie) was aired on NHK BS Premium as one of the Summer Vacation Anime Specials.
