Before long, Masaki encounters him again as a new classmate named Shou Akitsuki.\n\nShou is a skilled surfer and has been immersed in the sport since childhood.

He learns quickly and eventually enters a local competition, all with Shou and Tanaka by his side. However, behind Shou's gentle smile lurks a darker shadow, threatening to overwhelm his friends.

To save the injured Yamato, Eiji passes the tattoo onto him, entrusting him with protecting the Akatsuki Special Ward in his sacrifice.\n\nAs the ward continues to collapse under conflict, will Yamato be able to use his newfound Scard powers to protect his loved ones, or will he falter trying to become the new Hero of Akatsuki?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":309,"type":"anime","name":"GoHands","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/309/GoHands"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":48456,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48456/SK∞__Crazy_Rock_Jam","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/113409l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"SK∞: Crazy Rock Jam"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SK8 the Infinity Episode 9.5"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SK8 the Infinity Recap"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"SK∞ エスケーエイト #9.5 PART『クレイジーロックJAM』"}],"title":"SK∞: Crazy Rock Jam","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"SK∞ エスケーエイト #9.5 PART『クレイジーロックJAM』","title_synonyms":["SK8 the Infinity Episode 9.5","SK8 the Infinity Recap"],"type":"Special","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":3,"year":2021},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 14, 2021"},"duration":"23 min","rating":"PG-13 -

Santa Company's elves—known as \"tonttus\"—aid several Santas every year by wrapping presents, raising reindeer, and helping with deliveries. Mint Rondo is one of the many new tonttus arriving at Santa Company's tropical island office. Following in her older brother's footsteps, Mint begins training alongside her friend, Thomas Dou, and rival, Noah, to eventually become a Santa herself. Unfortunately, her clumsiness causes her to fall far behind her peers and into her brother's shadow.\n\nOne day, while sitting on the beach, Mint, Thomas, and Noah discover the biggest threat that Santa Company has faced yet: ocean pollution! With the accumulation of litter going unnoticed, the growing hazard will soon endanger the surrounding ocean wildlife and the members of the Santa Company. As trouble looms over the horizon, Mint might just be able to clean up her act and save everyone on the island in time for Christmas Eve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas was produced in conjunction with the Nippon Foundation's \"Change for the Blue\" initiative in order to raise awareness about ocean pollution as part of the Umi-to-Nippon project.

Today, he's a nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang's cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.\n\nAfter being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata's younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend's tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:08","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:08 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Ultra Super Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"Delinquents","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/55/Delinquents"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":41025,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41025/Fumetsu_no_Anata_e","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/118484l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"YOn779f6lwI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOn779f6lwI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOn779f6lwI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOn779f6lwI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOn779f6lwI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOn779f6lwI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOn779f6lwI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOn779f6lwI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fumetsu no Anata e"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"To You"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"the Immortal"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"不滅のあなたへ"},{"type":"English","title":"To Your Eternity"},{"type":"German","title":"To Your Eternity"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"To Your Eternity"},{"type":"French","title":"To Your Eternity"}],"title":"Fumetsu no Anata e","title_english":"To Your Eternity","title_japanese":"不滅のあなたへ","title_synonyms":["To You","the Immortal"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":20,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":4,"year":2021},"to":{"day":30,"month":8,"year":2021}},"string":"Apr 12, 2021 to Aug 30, 2021"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.35,"scored_by":351768,"rank":209,"popularity":200,"members":838206,"favorites":13999,"synopsis":"An Orb, known only as It, is cast to Earth to be observed from afar.

But what would happen if you live long enough to keep defeating them for 300 years?\n\nAfter many years of being a corporate slave, Azusa Aizawa abruptly passes away due to severe exhaustion. Seemingly headed for the afterlife, she meets a goddess who bestows her with immortality alongside a peaceful life in another world. There, Azusa enjoys her days tending to her farm, protecting the nearby village, and killing about 25 slimes per day—a routine that continues for at least three centuries.\n\nHowever, this rather monotonous cycle begins to change when Azusa suddenly finds out that she has reached level 99—the maximum possible level—from slimes alone. Despite desperately trying to hide this fact in fear of ending her slow life, rumors of her strength spread nevertheless. Soon enough, various people throughout the continent, like the dragon Laika and the elf Halkara, start to appear at her doorstep—some seeking a battle, others asking for her assistance. Meeting friends and acquaintances who soon become family, Azusa finds she can live a life far better with others than when she was alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"21:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 21:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":775,"type":"anime","name":"Bushiroad","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1337,"type":"anime","name":"Medicos Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1337/Medicos_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":2117,"type":"anime","name":"SB Creative","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2117/SB_Creative"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1692,"type":"anime","name":"Revoroot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1692/Revoroot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"},{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Reincarnation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":41456,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41456/Sentouin_Hakenshimasu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/115118l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"3DHctZTqsFo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHctZTqsFo","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DHctZTqsFo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3DHctZTqsFo/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3DHctZTqsFo/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3DHctZTqsFo/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3DHctZTqsFo/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3DHctZTqsFo/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"戦闘員、派遣します！"},{"type":"English","title":"Combatants Will Be Dispatched!"},{"type":"German","title":"Kombattanten Werden Entsandt!"}],"title":"Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!","title_english":"Combatants Will Be Dispatched!","title_japanese":"戦闘員、派遣します！","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2021},"to":{"day":20,"month":6,"year":2021}},"string":"Apr 4, 2021 to Jun 20, 2021"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.16,"scored_by":170282,"rank":3362,"popularity":624,"members":361018,"favorites":1983,"synopsis":"As a chief operative of the villainous Kisaragi Corporation, Sentouin Roku-gou receives orders to help the organization conquer the entire known universe.

But it soon became apparent that the game was too realistic, and the popularity of VRMMOs in general gradually began to plunge.\n\nAt present, due to an accident a few years prior, the high school student Hiroshi Yuuki now immerses himself in full-dive RPGs as a form of escapism. After failing to acquire the latest version of his favorite game, Hiroshi stumbles upon a game shop and meets its beautiful clerk Reona Kisaragi who convinces him to buy a copy of Kiwame Quest so that they can play together. \n\nThe first time Hiroshi plays the game, he marvels at the realism it offers. However, his astonishment is short-lived as he sets off a series of misfortunes, quickly realizing that the game is even worse than his already stressful life. Nevertheless, Hiroshi still finds himself logging on again despite his growing contempt for the game.

When the search for the lost star begins to sour, the Pretty Boy Detective Club end up entangled in something far beyond what they ever imagined. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":81,"type":"anime","name":"Crossdressing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/81/Crossdressing"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/80/Visual_Arts"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":47250,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/47250/Jouran__The_Princess_of_Snow_and_Blood","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1289/115673l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"KdTZ-XQhFdE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdTZ-XQhFdE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdTZ-XQhFdE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KdTZ-XQhFdE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KdTZ-XQhFdE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KdTZ-XQhFdE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KdTZ-XQhFdE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KdTZ-XQhFdE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"擾乱 THE PRINCESS OF SNOW AND BLOOD"},{"type":"English","title":"Joran The Princess of Snow and Blood"}],"title":"Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood","title_english":"Joran The Princess of Snow and Blood","title_japanese":"擾乱 THE PRINCESS OF SNOW AND BLOOD","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":4,"year":2021},"to":{"day":23,"month":6,"year":2021}},"string":"Apr 7, 2021 to Jun 23, 2021"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.09,"scored_by":28836,"rank":8826,"popularity":2093,"members":93260,"favorites":380,"synopsis":"In 1931, the Tokugawa Shogunate remains in power, marking the 64th year of the Meiji era.

What in the world is the deity that has awoken beneath the seal?\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":235,"type":"anime","name":"Shirogumi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/235/Shirogumi"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":47405,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/47405/Wanmei_Shijie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1619/137928l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"4aVauYFSN9c","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aVauYFSN9c","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aVauYFSN9c?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4aVauYFSN9c/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4aVauYFSN9c/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4aVauYFSN9c/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4aVauYFSN9c/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4aVauYFSN9c/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Wanmei Shijie"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"完美世界"},{"type":"English","title":"Perfect World"}],"title":"Wanmei Shijie","title_english":"Perfect World","title_japanese":"完美世界","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Novel","episodes":182,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2021-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":23,"month":4,"year":2021},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 23, 2021 to ?"},"duration":"19 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.48,"scored_by":1589,"rank":1873,"popularity":6477,"members":8997,"favorites":127,"synopsis":"Born into a unique world where villages fight to gain power and control, the main character, Shi Hao, is a genius blessed by the heavens born under the poorest of conditions.\n\nHis clan, however, has a mysterious past.

This results in a large-scale athletic tournament, the \"Daiundoukai,\" where several aspiring female athletes from all around the solar system compete. The winner of the tournament is crowned the \"Cosmo Beauty,\" obtaining a queenlike status.\n\nWhen outgoing potato farmer Kanata Akehoshi was a child, she witnessed a meteor-like object falling from the sky, crashing in a nearby forest. When she came to investigate the wreckage, she saw a damaged spaceship and a girl who seemed to have been in it weakened by the impact. The girl gave Kanata two wristbands, alongside a request that Kanata join the Daiundoukai and become the Cosmo Beauty. Kanata obliged, but before she could ask for the girl's name, she mysteriously disappeared—leaving nothing,not even the crater caused by the crash.

Junior high school student Kezuru wakes up after a strange dream featuring himself as a wizard, a creature called \"mazin,\" and a mysterious girl. The next day, his friend Kuracchi proudly shows off the newly launched Mazica Party card game. To Kezuru's shock, all the characters drawn in the game's cards are just like the ones in his dream.\n\nMeanwhile, Kezuru receives a notification for an event at the major international company Mazica. Intrigued, Kezuru goes to the Mazica Store as directed, only to meet the Mazica CEO himself, Jeff Johns. Johns says, \"I have great expectations for you,\" and hands Kezuru Mazica Gear.\n\nOn his way back home, Kezuru is attacked by an airship-like creature. Just when he thinks, \"this is it!\" to himself, his Mazica Gear erupts and a magic book appears. When he scratches a card, he seals a contract with Barunya, a \"mazin\" creature that is an odd remixed fusion between an airship and a cat.\n\nThe mysterious girl Anya says Kezuru and those of his ilk will be \"the true wizards who save the world.\" Amid all these mysterious revelations, Kezuru enrolls in the Mazica Academy and engages in Mazica Party card battles alongside his partner mazin.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"09:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 09:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":100,"type":"anime","name":"TV Osaka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/100/TV_Osaka"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":49170,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49170/Xinghe_Zhizun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1266/115772l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Xinghe Zhizun"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Supreme Galaxy"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"星河至尊"}],"title":"Xinghe Zhizun","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"星河至尊","title_synonyms":["Supreme Galaxy"],"type":"ONA","source":"Web novel","episodes":45,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":6,"year":2021},"to":{"day":30,"month":10,"year":2021}},"string":"Jun 10, 2021 to Oct 30, 2021"},"duration":"7 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.92,"scored_by":368,"rank":9678,"popularity":11520,"members":1605,"favorites":8,"synopsis":"Once the most dazzling blue earth star of the first door of the star clan, accidentally got the world of the treasure \"star map,\" attracted the eyes of the lord of the world.

According to legend, he created a cursed grimoire known as the \"Book of Vanitas,\" and it is said he would one day use it to bring retribution upon all vampires of the crimson moon.\n\nIn 19th century Paris, Noé Archiviste is searching for the fabled Book of Vanitas. Whilst traveling aboard an airship, he is saved from a vampire attack by an eccentric doctor who calls himself Vanitas and carries the very tome he seeks. Ironically, the self-proclaimed vampire specialist is a mere human who inherited both his name and the book from his master, the same Vanitas of legend.

While finding his own way to shine in the sport, Ryouma investigates a perplexing development: the circumstances behind his father's retirement from professional tennis. \n\nKnown as \"Samurai Nanjiro,\" Ryouma's father Nanjiro is a legendary tennis player whose career abruptly ended after the US Open finals several years prior. Though Ryouma has studied the final match extensively, there are still many gaps in his understanding—gaps that he would only be able to fill by watching the match in person. \n\nAs luck would have it, a supernatural phenomenon transports the young prodigy—and his unsuspecting classmate, Sakuno Ryuzaki—back in time to that very event. Although the events that occur before the game seem normal at first glance, the appearance of the mafia soon complicates the mystery behind the retirement. Despite the bad odds, Ryouma must do everything he can to unravel the circumstances and prevent his father's career from ending.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ryouma!

Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta's curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him.\n\nYuuta's unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Gojou sees immense potential in Yuuta, and he hopes to help the boy channel his deadly burden into a force for good.

However, despite her illness, she has always dreamed of becoming an idol. Eventually, her opportunity comes in the form of the seventh Selection Project—a brutal series of competitions best known as the starting point of the legendary idol Akari Amasawa.\n\nAnxious but excited, Suzune enters the preliminary round of Selection Project. Though her singing dazzles the judges and her fellow competitors, Suzune is unfortunately overcome by her nerves and freezes up in the middle of her performance.

Soon after, he realizes that his dream was nothing more than the recollections of his life in an alternative universe. In those memories, the Alternative V project is implemented, sending hundreds of thousands of people into space as a last resort to preserve humanity, while leaving the remaining billion on Earth to suffer a cruel fate.\n\nYearning to change this grim future, Takeru joins a military base in Yokohama, which happens to be his former high school. There, he manages to convince the base's vice-commander and leader of the Alternative IV project, Professor Yuuko Kouzuki, to prevent Alternative V from happening. To ensure the success of Alternative IV, Takeru must pilot the gigantic humanoid machines Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) alongside his fellow cadets. However, he has only two months to complete his training and exploit his partial knowledge of the future—lest the ensuing tragedy take place.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Muv-Luv Alternative adapts the first six chapters of the visual novel of the same name, which is the third and final part of the Muv-Luv trilogy.","season":"fall","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":1617,"type":"anime","name":"Tencent Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1617/Tencent_Japan"},{"mal_id":1840,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"},{"mal_id":2460,"type":"anime","name":"aNCHOR","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2460/aNCHOR"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":96,"type":"anime","name":"Yumeta Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/96/Yumeta_Company"},{"mal_id":894,"type":"anime","name":"Graphinica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/894/Graphinica"},{"mal_id":2249,"type":"anime","name":"Flagship Line","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2249/Flagship_Line"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":48567,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48567/Visual_Prison","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/117924l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"GobEj1oZqFs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GobEj1oZqFs","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GobEj1oZqFs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GobEj1oZqFs/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GobEj1oZqFs/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GobEj1oZqFs/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GobEj1oZqFs/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GobEj1oZqFs/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Visual Prison"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ヴィジュアルプリズン"},{"type":"English","title":"Visual Prison"}],"title":"Visual Prison","title_english":"Visual Prison","title_japanese":"ヴィジュアルプリズン","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":10,"year":2021},"to":{"day":25,"month":12,"year":2021}},"string":"Oct 9, 2021 to Dec 25, 2021"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.71,"scored_by":9237,"rank":5501,"popularity":3421,"members":39554,"favorites":472,"synopsis":"Vampires have existed for centuries and live under the rule of the Scarlet Moon.

While initially planned to be released in 2020, the film was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anime Expo Lite 2021 hosted a preview of the movie on July 3, 2021. Netflix streamed the film on February 8, 2022 after acquiring its distribution license. Inspired by the Japanese mythology behind Izumo's Kamiari Festival, Kamiarizuki no Kodomo is an original story by Cretica Universal's founder Toshinari Shinohe, who aimed to express and convey Japan's rich culture to the world. A sticker rally was held in Shimane from October 8, 2021 to February 28, 2022, allowing visitors to see locations associated with the movie and obtain special stickers at three designated points. Kodansha issued three books based on the movie prior to its release on August 12, 2021, September 15, 2021, and September 30, 2021, respectively.

In order to accomplish their great ambitions and extend the bloodline of their family, countless heroes of Zichuan gave their lives in order to make this magnificent hymn come to life. This is a story about this legendary family and a hundred years of their blood and tears. \n\n(Source: AniList)","background":"Animated adaptation of Lao Zhu's (老猪) novel of the same title.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1727,"type":"anime","name":"Tencent Penguin Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1727/Tencent_Penguin_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2191,"type":"anime","name":"BUILD DREAM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2191/BUILD_DREAM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":50427,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50427/Ikuta_no_Kita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/119588l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"YKk0rYivomc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKk0rYivomc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKk0rYivomc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YKk0rYivomc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YKk0rYivomc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YKk0rYivomc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YKk0rYivomc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YKk0rYivomc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ikuta no Kita"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Des dizaines de Nords"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"幾多の北"},{"type":"English","title":"Dozens of Norths"}],"title":"Ikuta no Kita","title_english":"Dozens of Norths","title_japanese":"幾多の北","title_synonyms":["Des dizaines de Nords"],"type":"Movie","source":"Other","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":11,"year":2021},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 6, 2021"},"duration":"1 hr 4 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.31,"scored_by":349,"rank":7662,"popularity":11222,"members":1787,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"North is everywhere solitary.

The Dangerous Situation selected the elites of the elite to form an ace squad, named the Phantom. Three years ago, in a task of receiving treasures, due to the gullibility of the captain, Hyway, the Phantom Squad was attacked by the Derek Squad, and almost all of them were killed in action. Hyway himself was planted by Derek and fell into the cliff. However, the target treasure, the Immortal Stone, accidentally entered into Haoyuan's body, bringing him back from the dead, gaining the ability to manipulate time, and possessing super powers such as time static and time reversal. Our protagonist has lived as a fugitive from then on. Haoyuan didn't want to face the past, and chose to remain anonymous, leading a plain life, and guarding Gu Xiaoxi, the sister of his comrade-in-arms. But God’s will, a blue virus appeared in City Y, and the infected person’s skin appeared blue, then spread all over the body little by little, and eventually died. And Gu Xiaoxi was also infected. In order to break the blue virus incident and save Gu Xiaoxi, Hyway returns to the crisis situation. With the sexy and capable secret agent Yu Jie-Xia Rou, the quirky genius Loli-Tong Xiaoxiao, and the second-biggest gangster-Zhan Peng and other weird celebrities make a makeshift to form an alternative phantom team. And our legendary story begins here. \n\n(Source:  Youku.com, rough translation)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":2447,"type":"anime","name":"Youku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2447/Youku"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":51871,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51871/Hisui_Kobanashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/123934l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hisui Kobanashi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Pokémon stop motion animation"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ヒスイ小噺"},{"type":"English","title":"Pokémon Kids TV: Hisuian Voltorb is Berry Sorry"}],"title":"Hisui Kobanashi","title_english":"Pokémon Kids TV: Hisuian Voltorb is Berry Sorry","title_japanese":"ヒスイ小噺","title_synonyms":["Pokémon stop motion animation"],"type":"ONA","source":"Game","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":12,"year":2021},"to":{"day":14,"month":12,"year":2021}},"string":"Dec 10, 2021 to Dec 14, 2021"},"duration":"1 min per ep","rating":"PG - Children","score":5.71,"scored_by":244,"rank":10535,"popularity":15029,"members":550,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"It's said that Hisuian Voltorb has a friendly personality...but it frequently shocks nearby Pokémon when it gets excited. \nSee what happens when Hisuian Voltorb gets carried away!\n\n(Source: Official YouTube Channel)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":50218,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50218/Makafushigi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/119247l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Makafushigi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"MAKAFUKA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"摩訶不思議"}],"title":"Makafushigi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"摩訶不思議","title_synonyms":["MAKAFUKA"],"type":"Music","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":10,"year":2021},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 25, 2021"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.8,"scored_by":287,"rank":null,"popularity":15142,"members":534,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Special animation for the collaboration between the MMORPG \"Gran Saga\" and the band RADWIMPS.

It depicts the eldest son, who had to be the pillar of a poor family, and a worker who had no choice but to set fire to the labor movement by collaborating with his colleagues, who did not even know how to protest. At the same time, the film depicts the scenery and characters of the more lyrical time in which Chun Taeil lived. \n\nChun Tae-il is a detailed portrait of the people who wanted to live like human beings in impossible times presented as a painful and beautiful animated film. The voice actors include actors Jang Dongyoon as Chun; Yeom Hyeran as Chun′s mother, Lee Sosun; and Jin Seonkyu; Park Chulmin; and Kwon Haehyo.
