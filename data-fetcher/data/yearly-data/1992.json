As he puzzles he way toward the correct course of action, he befriends two powerful warriors, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu. Together, they take the Oath of the Peach Garden, to live and die together as warriors for justice. Meanwhile, Cao Cao is pondering how to fulfill his destiny as \"a hero in a chaotic world or a villain in a peaceful one.\"\n\nInitially, power seems to belong to usurping warlord Dong Zhuo and his right-hand man, the hero Lu Bu. But the two soon fall out over a woman, and the resulting power vacuum gives Cao Cao his chance. Even though Lu Bu is the stronger warrior, Cao Cao has the devil's own luck on the battlefield. Liu Bei tries to stick to the right course, but he is just a minor piece on the giant chessboard of China's warring states. War rages up and down the country, with inconclusive result, thus setting the stage for the next two movies in the series.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1147,"type":"anime","name":"Shinano Kikaku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1147/Shinano_Kikaku"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":7488,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7488/Karo_to_Piyobupt__Ame_no_Hi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/17975l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Karo to Piyobupt: Ame no Hi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Rainy Day"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Rainy Days"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"カロとピヨブプト-あめのひ"},{"type":"English","title":"Karo & Piyobupt: Imagination"}],"title":"Karo to Piyobupt: Ame no Hi","title_english":"Karo & Piyobupt: Imagination","title_japanese":"カロとピヨブプト-あめのひ","title_synonyms":["Rainy Day","Rainy Days"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1992},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1992"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.02,"scored_by":452,"rank":12483,"popularity":13653,"members":823,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Karo was hurrying to his house on a rainy day.

Midori finds little success until, one day, she is approached by a gentleman who offers his sympathy and aid. When her bedridden mother succumbs to an illness, and with no one else to turn to, Midori visits the man's address. To her horror, she discovers that she has been conned into joining his circus troupe, Aka Neko Za—a traveling freak show consisting of vulgar and deformed performers.\n\nMidori compares her new fairground lifestyle to hell. Not only is she responsible for caring for her colleagues and cleaning up after them, but she also is frequently belittled and cruelly abused. Suffering and uncertain of what will become of her, she finally begins to feel at ease when Wonder Masamitsu, a master illusionist, joins the lineup. Smitten by Midori's beauty and innocence, Masamitsu takes her under his wing; but even as their love grows, dark times loom ahead for Midori and her fellow freaks.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The \"Shoujo Tsubaki\" or \"Camellia Girl\" character was a common stock protagonist regularly featured in Japanese street theater throughout the 1920s. The character typically manifested as a young and impoverished female adolescent who sold camellia flowers on the streets. One incarnation of the character features in a short story, also titled \"Shouji Tsubaki,\" within an anthology—eventually repurposed as a full-length graphic novel by Suehiro Maruo, known as Mr. Arashi’s Amazing Freak Show in English. This, in turn, was adapted into the animated film Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki, which roughly translates to \"Underground Projected Dramatic Pictures: The Camellia Girl.\" The film is known simply as Midori in releases outside of Japan. Aside from the music, sound effects, and an uncredited voice cast, the entirety of the film was created almost exclusively by Hiroshi Harada under the pseudonym \"Hisaaki Etsu,\" who handled directing, scripting, drawing, and animating. Composer J. A. Seazer assisted with the soundtrack. Production began in 1987, the film took five years to produce, and it consists of over five thousand hand-drawn sheets of animation. Due to the film’s graphic imagery, the production received no sponsors and was instead funded using Harada’s life savings and retirement fund. The early marketing for the film was deliberately cryptic, and Harada intended for it to only be viewed at specially held screenings. The film premiered in May 1992 under a large red tent at the Mitake Jinja Shinto Shrine in Tokyo. It was accompanied by realtime special effects, including confetti and smoke bombs. Underground theater group Aka Neko Za performed stunts from the film and interacted with the audience throughout its duration. These performances would complement the film in succeeding years, before its ban. Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki was screened unedited until 1994, when Japanese film censor board Eirin made 26 cuts and alterations. From 1994 to 2006, the film could only be viewed in its heavily censored state at film festival screenings and theaters. During this time, there were no home releases. In 1999, the film was screened at the San Sebastián Horror and Fantasy Film Festival in Spain. When the tapes were returned to Japan, they were seized and destroyed by Japanese Customs at Narita Airport; it was thereafter banned from domestic imports and screenings in Japan. Nonetheless, it was specially screened at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival in 2004, where it won first place in a fan vote. Directly after, a ban was placed on the film at the request of the police, which lasted eight more years in Japan. In 2006, the French company Ciné Malta obtained the rights to release the film on DVD in its original form. This was the first time the uncensored version of Midori was accessible since screenings before 1994. The DVD also included English, Spanish, Italian, and German subtitles, as well various features—including a recorded interview with Harada and a 16-page booklet. However, the tapes initially sent to France were confiscated as \"obscene material\" at De Gaulle Airport due to cautionary notices attached to the shipments by Narita Airport. As of the 2010s, the film was screened frequently throughout Asia and Europe—especially the latter—but never in the United States, due to import laws regarding certain types of pornography. In 2013, the original 16 mm negatives of the film were discovered in a warehouse belonging to Japanese post-production company IMAGICA. The film was remastered and screened in digital format, including at the Kanazawa Film Festival that same year. Regardless, Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki will forever be notorious for its taboo content and complex history. It is in some regards considered lost media and is also considered one of the most controversial anime due to being banned almost everywhere, including in Japan.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":170,"type":"anime","name":"Imagica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/170/Imagica"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1441,"type":"anime","name":"Mippei Eigeki Kiryuukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1441/Mippei_Eigeki_Kiryuukan"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1262,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1262/Macross_II__Lovers_Again","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/61069l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Macross II: Lovers Again"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Choujikuu Yousai Macross II - Lovers Again"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Macross II The Movie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Super Dimension Fortress Macross II: Lovers"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Again"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"超時空要塞マクロスII -Lovers Again-"},{"type":"French","title":"Macross II"}],"title":"Macross II: Lovers Again","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"超時空要塞マクロスII -Lovers Again-","title_synonyms":["Choujikuu Yousai Macross II - Lovers Again","Macross II The Movie","Super Dimension Fortress Macross II: Lovers","Again"],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":6,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1992-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1992-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":5,"year":1992},"to":{"day":21,"month":11,"year":1992}},"string":"May 21, 1992 to Nov 21, 1992"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.29,"scored_by":6172,"rank":7757,"popularity":5618,"members":12766,"favorites":24,"synopsis":"A.D. 2089 - 80 years have passed since Space War I changed the lives of both human and Zentraedi races.

This power lies in the form of a magical, light-emanating compact which was given to the Miroku clan. Anyone who bathes in the compact's light will be held victim to the Shikima's perverted assaults.\n\nMiko Mido is the latest descendent in the line of Miroku and is trying to juggle her life as a high school student with her training in \"sexcraft\" ninjutsu. Her grandmother serves as the guardian of the Miroku's compact. But a planned assault by the Suzuka clan not only leaves Miko as the sole guardian of the bloodline, but also results in the compact being stolen by the Suzuka. Determined to finish off the last of the Miroku, the Suzuka turn the power of the Shikima against the inexperienced Miko, putting her in a fight for control of the destructive demons, as well as her own life.\n\nMiko's situation is made even more troubling when she accidentally exposes her sister, Miyu to the terrors of the Shikima, resulting in her being abducted and taken to the demons' dimension.

Together they seek Gaia, which they believe to be a fabulous treasure, but they are pursued by Uranus's minions : V-Darn the vicious mage-knight, V-Sion the warrior woman and Akumako, V-Darn's sadistic imp-like partner.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":155,"type":"anime","name":"animate Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"},{"mal_id":1131,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G Room","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1131/Zero-G_Room"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3874,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3874/Ashita_e_Free_Kick","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/69971l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ashita e Free Kick"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Free Kick Toward Tomorrow"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あしたへフリーキック"}],"title":"Ashita e Free Kick","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"あしたへフリーキック","title_synonyms":["Free Kick Toward Tomorrow"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1992-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1993-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":4,"year":1992},"to":{"day":24,"month":4,"year":1993}},"string":"Apr 14, 1992 to Apr 24, 1993"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.44,"scored_by":756,"rank":6973,"popularity":10572,"members":2238,"favorites":5,"synopsis":"Shun Godai is a young boy who likes soccer.

There were just the beginning signs of reformation in the long regime of Shogun Tokugawa.\n\nIn the remote countryside, on the island of Shikoko, a young boy named Ryoma is growing up in a lower-class Samurai family. A decade later, he is to become on of the leading figures to topple the Shogun's reign and open Japan to the western world.\n\nOur story begins with Ryoma, a dreaming kid of seven years. Ryoma is an honest and tenderd-hearted boy who hates any sort of violence and brutality. He is so sensitive, and a bit naive, that he often cries from pity when he sees even the simples act of violence such as another kid trampling a tiny insect. The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.\n\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth. She recognizes that her brother is gifted with a special talent and she does her best to protect him and cheer him up.\n\n(Source: Enoki Films USA)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1992,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":326,"type":"anime","name":"Animation 21","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/326/Animation_21"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3155,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3155/Kingyo_Chuuihou_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1920/104412l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kingyo Chuuihou!
