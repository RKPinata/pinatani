Further complicating things is Kairi Okayasu, a popular male student at Momo's high school who has publicly declared his love for her and is determined to date her.\n\nHoping to find love in a nearly impossible predicament, Momo must navigate complicated love triangles, back-stabbing friends, and her insecurities about her appearance to discover who she really is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"07:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 07:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":82,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/82/Marvelous_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":126,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Comet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/126/Studio_Comet"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Love Polygon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":487,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/487/Girls_Bravo__Second_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1538/133872l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Girls Bravo: Second Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"GIRLSブラボー second season"},{"type":"English","title":"Girls Bravo: Second Season"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Girls Bravo Temporada 2"}],"title":"Girls Bravo: Second Season","title_english":"Girls Bravo: Second Season","title_japanese":"GIRLSブラボー second season","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":1,"year":2005},"to":{"day":21,"month":4,"year":2005}},"string":"Jan 27, 2005 to Apr 21, 2005"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.61,"scored_by":48299,"rank":5995,"popularity":2136,"members":90694,"favorites":130,"synopsis":"Small for his age, Yukinari has been bullied and abused by girls all his life.

However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear. Disgusted by this arrogance, an old Karas turns his back on the laws he had once upheld, and in his human form, named Eko, he creates an army of Mikura, or mechanized demons, to ready an attack on the human race.\n\nA young man named Otoha inherits the powers of the Karas and takes his place at the side of Yurine, who claims that his soul called out for her while he lived the life of a human. They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset.\n\nMeanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue.

The outside was so cold and dark, he looked for another house but humans put hiiragi iwashi (holly and sardine head talismans) on house entrances to keep demons away and he could not get in. However, there was only one house without this talisman and without throwing the roasted soybeans. In this house, a girl and sick mother lived together. The girl kept vigil beside her mother’s bed all days and did not have enough time and money to eat meal, not to mention throwing roasted soybeans. Realizing the predicament they were in, Onita found meal from somewhere. Disguising as a man, he offered the meal he got to the girl, saying that he made too much for Setsubun. The meals he offered were sekihan and green bean dish.

He desires to leave his home behind and join the mercenary group known as Gekkostate, hoping to find some adventure to brighten up his mundane life. However, stuck between his grandfather's insistence to become a mechanic like him and the pressure of his deceased father's legacy, the only excitement Renton finds is in his pastime of riding the Trapar wave particles that are dispersed throughout the air, an activity akin to surfing.\n\nEverything changes when an unknown object crashes through Renton's garage, discovered to be a Light Finding Operation—a robot capable of riding the Trapar waves—specifically known as the Nirvash typeZERO. Its pilot is a young girl named Eureka, a member of the Gekkostate, who requests a tune-up for the Nirvash. Their meeting sparks the beginning of Renton's involvement with the Gekkostate as he takes off alongside Eureka as the co-pilot of the Nirvash.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Koukyoushihen Eureka Seven has won multiple awards including \"Best Screenplay,\" \"Best Television Series,\" and \"Best Character Designs\" at the 5th Tokyo Anime Awards, an award in the \"Domestic Digital Contents Category\" at the 20th Digital Content Grand Prix, and the \"Best Female Character\" and \"Best Television Series\" during the 2006 Anime Expo SPJA Awards in the US.","season":"spring","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"07:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 07:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":230,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"},{"mal_id":242,"type":"anime","name":"Ashi Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1097,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Games","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"},{"mal_id":1488,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Media Partners","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1488/Hakuhodo_DY_Media_Partners"},{"mal_id":1588,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Channel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1588/Bandai_Channel"},{"mal_id":1615,"type":"anime","name":"USEN","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1615/USEN"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":16,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/133577l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"6TN4a0kZuXg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TN4a0kZuXg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TN4a0kZuXg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TN4a0kZuXg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TN4a0kZuXg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TN4a0kZuXg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TN4a0kZuXg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TN4a0kZuXg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hachimitsu to Clover"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"HachiKuro"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Honey & Clover"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハチミツとクローバー"},{"type":"English","title":"Honey and Clover"},{"type":"German","title":"Honey and Clover"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Honey and Clover"},{"type":"French","title":"Honey and Clover"}],"title":"Hachimitsu to Clover","title_english":"Honey and Clover","title_japanese":"ハチミツとクローバー","title_synonyms":["HachiKuro","Honey & Clover"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":4,"year":2005},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2005}},"string":"Apr 15, 2005 to Sep 27, 2005"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

Furthermore, extremist groups like the Rosenkreuz Order strive to rekindle a war, despite the factions' attempts to avoid direct conflict.\n\nTo combat terrorist organizations, the Vatican has implemented the AX unit. Led by Cardinal Caterina Sforza, the AX agents investigate vampire-related disturbances with hopes that the Terrans and the Methuselah will one day achieve peaceful coexistence. Amongst the AX unit is priest Abel Nightroad—a seemingly disoriented but gentle-hearted fellow who is a fierce vampire slayer on the battlefield. Joining the unit as his partner is agent Sister Esther Blanchett, a brave and gentle young nun troubled with a tragic past. \n\nAs the two grow closer, they begin to uncover signs of malicious schemes and dark forces working in the shadows. But the path they walk is riddled with misfortune that might just force them to confront the memories that plague their hearts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Trinity Blood premiered in Japan on the satellite network WOWOW on April 28, 2005 and ran until October 6, 2005.

The shards spread all through the world, each containing evil. If a shard went inside your eye, it would turn your heart to ice. A shard went into Kai's eye. After that, he grew cold to those he loved. \n\nOne night, the Snow Queen came in her carriage and took Kai back to her ice castle at the farthest north point of the world. Everyone in Kai and Gerda's village didn't know where he went and believed he died from drowning in the frozen-over lake. Gerda doesn't believe this, for she dreamed of seeing Kai enter the carriage. When a drunk man admits that he also saw this, Gerda starts realizing that maybe what she saw wasn't a dream. She packs her things and goes on a journey to save Kai and bring him back home. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":"Yuki no Joou was created in celebration of 200 years since Hans Christian Andersen's birth.

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta. Surprisingly, Van learns that the bandits had ties with The Claw Man, and in kidnapping Wendy's brother for a reason they did not disclose. After the bandits are dealt with easily, Van and, much to his chagrin, Wendy continue the journey in search of The Claw Man. Little do they know, however, that The Claw Man is involved with something more atrocious than either could fathom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":210,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Tulip","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/210/Studio_Tulip"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":591,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/591/Amaenaide_yo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32071l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Amaenaide yo!!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Amaenaideyo!!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あまえないでよっ!!"},{"type":"English","title":"Ah My Buddha"},{"type":"German","title":"Ah My Buddha!!"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Ah My Buddha!!"},{"type":"French","title":"Ah My Buddha!!"}],"title":"Amaenaide yo!!","title_english":"Ah My Buddha","title_japanese":"あまえないでよっ!!","title_synonyms":["Amaenaideyo!!"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":7,"year":2005},"to":{"day":16,"month":9,"year":2005}},"string":"Jul 1, 2005 to Sep 16, 2005"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.44,"scored_by":35466,"rank":6970,"popularity":2400,"members":74270,"favorites":81,"synopsis":"Satonaka Ikkou, a 16 year old boy, is a first year trainee at the Saienji Buddhist Temple.

In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.\n\nOne fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shakugan no Shana is licensed in North America by Funimation after Geneon withdrew from the American market, and made its first North American television debut in September of 2012 on the Funimation Channel.","season":"fall","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"},{"mal_id":741,"type":"anime","name":"Toshiba Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/741/Toshiba_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":745,"type":"anime","name":"Cosmic Ray","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/745/Cosmic_Ray"},{"mal_id":777,"type":"anime","name":"Showgate","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/777/Showgate"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":150,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/150/Blood_","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"mjJ1W08vCKM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjJ1W08vCKM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjJ1W08vCKM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjJ1W08vCKM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjJ1W08vCKM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjJ1W08vCKM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjJ1W08vCKM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjJ1W08vCKM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Blood+"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Blood Plus"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ブラッドプラス"},{"type":"English","title":"Blood+"}],"title":"Blood+","title_english":"Blood+","title_japanese":"ブラッドプラス","title_synonyms":["Blood Plus"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":50,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2006-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":10,"year":2005},"to":{"day":23,"month":9,"year":2006}},"string":"Oct 8, 2005 to Sep 23, 2006"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.62,"scored_by":157980,"rank":1372,"popularity":603,"members":371935,"favorites":4363,"synopsis":"Saya Otonashi is a seemingly ordinary girl living a mundane life with her adoptive family in Okinawa City.

However, high schooler Karin Maaka is unusual, even among her own kind. Unlike her vampire family, ever since she was a child, Karin has suffered from polycythemia: a rare disorder which causes her to periodically produce excessive amounts of blood. And the more blood she produces, the more anemic and lightheaded she gets, ultimately leading to frequent nosebleeds.\n\nHer only solution? Force her excess blood onto random strangers, which surprisingly causes these \"victims\" to become livelier and happier than before.

Unwilling to let this interrupt her life—even if her body is a bit crowded—Tazusa moves forward with skating, all while a pesky voice may just be able to help her achieve her dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:40","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:40 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":890,"type":"anime","name":"Karaku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/890/Karaku"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":70,"type":"anime","name":"Performing Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":670,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/670/Lamune","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/15900l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Lamune"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ラムネ"}],"title":"Lamune","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ラムネ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Visual novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":10,"year":2005},"to":{"day":27,"month":12,"year":2005}},"string":"Oct 11, 2005 to Dec 27, 2005"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.79,"scored_by":18115,"rank":5068,"popularity":3336,"members":41369,"favorites":70,"synopsis":"Lamune tells the story of a boy named Kenji and his childhood friend Nanami.

The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her friends.
