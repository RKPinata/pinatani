This is a reversal of the good guy/bad guy roles in the original story! (perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6468,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6468/Tensai_Bakabon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/60845l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"fDOB407Uv9U","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDOB407Uv9U","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDOB407Uv9U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fDOB407Uv9U/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fDOB407Uv9U/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fDOB407Uv9U/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fDOB407Uv9U/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fDOB407Uv9U/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tensai Bakabon"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Genius Bakabon"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"天才バカボン"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Cosas de Locos!! ¡Esto es lo que Hay!"}],"title":"Tensai Bakabon","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"天才バカボン","title_synonyms":["Genius Bakabon"],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":40,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1971-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1972-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":1971},"to":{"day":24,"month":6,"year":1972}},"string":"Sep 25, 1971 to Jun 24, 1972"},"duration":"30 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.42,"scored_by":385,"rank":7068,"popularity":12157,"members":1284,"favorites":3,"synopsis":"Tensai Bakabon is the tale of a child prodigy and his \"philosophical\" father.

More to the point, in matters of a romantic nature, Pusu-o conducts himself with an absolute lack of grace, restraint and general respect for women. Not surprisingly, his sex life is an endless succession of obnoxiously over-the-top come-ons and maniacal attempts to get some action, all of which culminate in total strike-outs. Pusu-o's own father is soon on hand to add insult to injury (the injury being the constant, gushing nosebleeds Pusu-o endures — the nasal blood geyser being Japanese cartoon shorthand for sexual frustration), and the cock blockage continues at Pusu-o's new job as a car salesman — until a trio of older women misinterpret his advances, intended only to make the pretty Yukiko jealous. The antics continue at a later date, when the married Pusu-o is cuckolded by an horny little birdie. When the humiliated surrogate dad witnesses the sexual prowess of the tryst's offspring, matters culminate in a finale worthy of the most bombastic Japanese tragedy. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":7980,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7980/Shin_Obake_no_Q-tarou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/19488l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shin Obake no Q-tarou"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shin Obake no Q-taro"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Obake no Q-taro (1971)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"新オバケのＱ太郎"}],"title":"Shin Obake no Q-tarou","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"新オバケのＱ太郎","title_synonyms":["Shin Obake no Q-taro","Obake no Q-taro (1971)"],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":70,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1971-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1972-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":1971},"to":{"day":27,"month":12,"year":1972}},"string":"Sep 1, 1971 to Dec 27, 1972"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.85,"scored_by":127,"rank":9972,"popularity":14915,"members":568,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"New misadventures of the dimwitted ghost Q-Tarou. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1971,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":28023,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/28023/Tsuru_no_Sugomori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tsuru no Sugomori"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nesting Cranes"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Cranes in their Nests"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"つるのすごもり"}],"title":"Tsuru no Sugomori","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"つるのすごもり","title_synonyms":["Nesting Cranes","Cranes in their Nests"],"type":"Movie","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1971-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":1971},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 1, 1971"},"duration":"17 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":13772,"popularity":18164,"members":277,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"An earnest tale of animal cooperation, as two out-of-place chickens try to make their home on an island inhabited by cranes.
