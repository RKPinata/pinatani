The RSF is often regarded as a failure both by the country's citizens and a government more interested in precipitating a war with a neighboring country than scientific achievement. Following the funeral of a fellow cadet, an unmotivated Shiro is walking in the city one night, when he bumps into Riquinni Nonderaiko, a young, pious woman, genuinely enthusiastic about the significance of space exploration.\n\nAs the two gradually bond, Riquinni's encouragement inspires Shiro to volunteer as a pilot for a prospective rocket ship, potentially becoming Honneamise's first man in space. Shiro and the RSF are soon joined by a team of elderly but eager scientists and engineers, and together, they embark on a mission to mold their nation's space program into a success. However, their efforts soon catch the attention of the government, which seems to have a different plan for the RSF in mind. Even as the odds are stacked against them, these men and women continue to stubbornly look to the sky, because somewhere among the frontiers of space may lie humanity's last chance at redemption.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the 1988 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":490,"type":"anime","name":"Maiden Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1466,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1466/Bandai_Visual_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1356,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1356/Hokuto_no_Ken_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1912/106020l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hokuto no Ken 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"HNK II"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"北斗の拳2"},{"type":"English","title":"Fist of the North Star 2"},{"type":"French","title":"KEN 2 Fist of the North Star"}],"title":"Hokuto no Ken 2","title_english":"Fist of the North Star 2","title_japanese":"北斗の拳2","title_synonyms":["HNK II"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":43,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1987-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1988-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":3,"year":1987},"to":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":1988}},"string":"Mar 12, 1987 to Feb 18, 1988"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.56,"scored_by":13319,"rank":1569,"popularity":3881,"members":30830,"favorites":135,"synopsis":"In the second series after Raoh has been defeated by Kenshiro a new rival appears.

To solve their cases, they battle the bad guys, rescue stolen treasure, and wrestle space aliens. No job is too big, no humiliation is too great, and no alien has too many tentacles to keep them from the big score. \n\nOn their latest mission, the Battle Can-Can girls are out to retrieve a stolen artifact known as the Cosmic Firefly, a gorgeous but fragile jewel worth many billions of dollars, much more than what they make in a year! In order to return it to the rightful owners, they must subdue the most vicious space pirates, have sex with aliens, and confront a traitor from within! \n\n(Source: animeondvd)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":2712,"type":"anime","name":"Studio G7","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2712/Studio_G7"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8214,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8214/Tekkamen_wo_Oe__dArtagnan_Monogatari_yori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21062l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tekkamen wo Oe: \"d'Artagnan Monogatari\" yori"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Anime Sanjushi Pilot Episode"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"After the man in the iron mask! from the Tale of D'Artagnan"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"鉄仮面を追えダルタニャン物語より"}],"title":"Tekkamen wo Oe: \"d'Artagnan Monogatari\" yori","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"鉄仮面を追えダルタニャン物語より","title_synonyms":["Anime Sanjushi Pilot Episode","After the man in the iron mask! from the Tale of D'Artagnan"],"type":"Special","source":"Novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1987-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":5,"year":1987},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 5, 1987"},"duration":"25 min","rating":"G -
