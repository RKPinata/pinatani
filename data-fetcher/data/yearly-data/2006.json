Or maybe the girl of his dreams, Arisu...\n\n(Source: Discotek Media)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2006,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":71,"type":"anime","name":"Mellow Head","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/71/Mellow_Head"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Trinet Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/63/Trinet_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Picture Magic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/78/Picture_Magic"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":671,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/671/Lemon_Angel_Project","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/36417l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Lemon Angel Project"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"レモン エンジェル プロジェクト"}],"title":"Lemon Angel Project","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"レモン エンジェル プロジェクト","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Other","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2006-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2006-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":1,"year":2006},"to":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":2006}},"string":"Jan 6, 2006 to Mar 31, 2006"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG - Children","score":6.52,"scored_by":2930,"rank":6528,"popularity":6633,"members":8453,"favorites":18,"synopsis":"Lemon Angel was once the greatest girl band of Japan, but then it broke up and most of its members vanished.

One day, while looking for a quiet and peaceful place to study, she stumbles across a seemingly unused music room. Upon entering, Haruhi is welcomed by the members of the well-known Host Club: a club in which attractive boys amuse girls from across the entire school.

However, the spiders are not alone, as \"Spider Riders\"—humans from the Outer World, known as Earthens in the Inner World, that are chosen by the Oracle—fight alongside them. Filled with wondrous tales of a mysterious pyramid and entrusted with his grandfather's journal, a young boy called Hunter Steele sets out on an exploration. There, his destined meeting with the Oracle occurs, and he is transported into the Inner World as a Spider Rider.\n\nFinding himself lost and confused in the middle of a forest, Hunter crosses paths with a giant spider named Shadow. Although reluctant, Shadow agrees to fight by his side. He then meets Corona—a skilled Spider Hunter and kind girl with a penchant for normal life. She shows him the ropes of being a Spider Rider, and educates him about the fate of the Inner World if the Insectors continue their tyrannical reign.\n\nThus begins the story of Hunter Steele, a heedless young boy on a quest to save the Inner World. But his task of retrieving the four Oracle Keys holding the Oracle's true power will lead him to an ultimate clash against Mantid, leader of the Insectors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2006,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

Furthermore, another massive earthquake hit Japan on August 15, splitting the country into two. While Japanese refugees were taken in by various countries, the Japanese government accepted aid from China and the United States, which eventually caused China to govern the North, and the USA to govern the South. 15 years later, the Japanese refugees residing in Taiwan and the Taiwanese citizens find themselves clashing with one another, due to job competition and the unimproving conditions of the Japanese refugees. Genichiro Ryu is a survivor of the catastrophic events that took place in Japan, but was raised in Taiwan by a couple who adopted him. He gets himself involved in the situation between the Taiwanese and the Japanese, hoping that the two parties will be able to coexist with one another. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":490,"type":"anime","name":"Maiden Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4071,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4071/Black_Jack_TV__Hizouban_Specials","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/7416l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Black Jack (TV): Hizouban Specials"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Black Jack: Lost Episodes"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ブラックジャック 秘蔵版スペシャル"}],"title":"Black Jack (TV): Hizouban Specials","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ブラックジャック 秘蔵版スペシャル","title_synonyms":["Black Jack: Lost Episodes"],"type":"Special","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2006-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":7,"year":2006},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 17, 2006"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.96,"scored_by":1041,"rank":4284,"popularity":9573,"members":3120,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"This was originally from the Black Jack (2004), but weren't aired then, only later.

In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.\n\nFor his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers.

Berated for his lack of spine as he wades through the underbelly of society, he must decide whether to continue on amidst the gunfire and ruthlessness or risk everything he has in an attempt to be free. Whether he chooses the comfort of a familiar land or the freedom of being an outlaw, his decision will have lasting consequences on the crew who gave him a home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2006,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:59","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:59 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":1559,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1559/Shijou_Saikyou_no_Deshi_Kenichi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75515l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"IZeFGHH7xWE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZeFGHH7xWE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZeFGHH7xWE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/IZeFGHH7xWE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/IZeFGHH7xWE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/IZeFGHH7xWE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/IZeFGHH7xWE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/IZeFGHH7xWE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"史上最強の弟子 ケンイチ"},{"type":"English","title":"KenIchi: The Mightiest Disciple"},{"type":"German","title":"Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple"}],"title":"Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi","title_english":"KenIchi: The Mightiest Disciple","title_japanese":"史上最強の弟子 ケンイチ","title_synonyms":["History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":50,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2006-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":10,"year":2006},"to":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":2007}},"string":"Oct 8, 2006 to Sep 30, 2007"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.05,"scored_by":155601,"rank":549,"popularity":770,"members":297608,"favorites":3542,"synopsis":"Whenever he is not getting pummeled in the karate club after school, high schooler Kenichi Shirahama can be found with his head buried in one of the many self-help books he carries with him every day. One day, on the way to school, Kenichi accidentally frightens the new student in his class, leading her to throw him down onto the ground. After apologizing for her violent reflexes, she introduces herself as Miu Furinji and asks Kenichi to be her friend.\n\nLater that day, after karate club practice, Kenichi is given an ultimatum by one of the other club members: they will fight next week and the loser has to quit the club permanently.

Along with Tokiko and her own Buso Renkin (the \"Valkyrie Skirt,\" an execution scythe), Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculi and their master.","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2006,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":2135,"type":"anime","name":"Imagine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":1594,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1594/Jigoku_Shoujo_Futakomori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86975l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hell Girl 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hell Girl Futakomori"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hell Girl Second Cage"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hell Girl: The Two Prisoners"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Jigoku Shoujo: Futagomori"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"地獄少女 二籠"},{"type":"English","title":"Hell Girl: Two Mirrors"}],"title":"Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori","title_english":"Hell Girl: Two Mirrors","title_japanese":"地獄少女 二籠","title_synonyms":["Hell Girl 2","Hell Girl Futakomori","Hell Girl Second Cage","Hell Girl: The Two Prisoners","Jigoku Shoujo: Futagomori"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2006-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":10,"year":2006},"to":{"day":7,"month":4,"year":2007}},"string":"Oct 7, 2006 to Apr 7, 2007"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.88,"scored_by":67260,"rank":804,"popularity":1411,"members":159419,"favorites":705,"synopsis":"Ai Enma and her companions continue to offer their service of revenge against those who have wronged others, and the price is as steep as ever—for damning the offender to hell, the person exacting vengeance is sent to the abyss as well.

When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan. \n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is. \n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge/assassinate him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them?

Dr. Bian Zoldark, head of the EOTI Institute (Extra-Over Technological Investigative Institute), had evidence the creators of the EOT were heading to Earth, in order to reclaim it...or worse, invade the planet. In order to defend humanity from extraterrestrial threats, the government begins to research and develop humanoid mecha called Personal Troopers.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2006,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"GDH","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/42/GDH"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":1121,"type":"anime","name":"Banpresto","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1121/Banpresto"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":1466,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1466/Bandai_Visual_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2870,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2870/Yagami_Yuu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1840/132981l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yagami Yuu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Anime Yagami Yuu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"八神優 (アニメ)"},{"type":"English","title":"Night Shift Nurses: Yagami Yu"}],"title":"Yagami Yuu","title_english":"Night Shift Nurses: Yagami Yu","title_japanese":"八神優 (アニメ)","title_synonyms":["Anime Yagami Yuu"],"type":"OVA","source":"Visual novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2006-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":12,"year":2006},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 21, 2006"},"duration":"32 min","rating":"Rx -
