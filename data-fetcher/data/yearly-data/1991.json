Juzo has unwisely made a bet with a rich merchant that he will sleep with Komurasaki, the most renowned courtesan in Edo, at the first meeting. If he succeeds he will win a villa, but if he loses he will lose his manhood. Yunosuke is astounded as he knows how hard the high rank courtesans are to get. The best courtesans, tayu, as well as being beautiful, were highly cultured, being educated in poetry, calligraphy, painting, tea ceremony and other arts. They would sleep with a client only on the third night, the other two nights being taken up with greetings and other social niceties. Humble men, to whom they were 'untouchable' looked up to them with adoration and respect.\n\nIndignant, Yunosuke takes Juzo to Edo and enables him to meet Komurasaki. Juzo is a laughing-stock at the tea-house because of his nervousness, and soon becomes drunk. He clumsily spills wine over the courtesan's kimono. Unperturbed, she goes out and returns wearing a fresh, identical garment.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":391,"type":"anime","name":"Grouper Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/391/Grouper_Productions"},{"mal_id":1952,"type":"anime","name":"Animation Staff Room","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1952/Animation_Staff_Room"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4532,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4532/Taiyou_no_Yuusha_Fighbird","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31133l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Taiyou no Yuusha Fighbird"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Brave Hero of the Sun"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Firebird"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Burning Brave Hero Firebird"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sun Brave Fyvard"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sun Guard"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"太陽の勇者ファイバード"},{"type":"English","title":"Brave of the Sun Fighbird"}],"title":"Taiyou no Yuusha Fighbird","title_english":"Brave of the Sun Fighbird","title_japanese":"太陽の勇者ファイバード","title_synonyms":["Brave Hero of the Sun","Firebird","Burning Brave Hero Firebird","Sun Brave Fyvard","The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird","Sun Guard"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":48,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1991-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1992-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":2,"year":1991},"to":{"day":1,"month":2,"year":1992}},"string":"Feb 2, 1991 to Feb 1, 1992"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.09,"scored_by":745,"rank":3734,"popularity":8997,"members":3786,"favorites":12,"synopsis":"An evil alien life form, Dryus, assaulted the Earth.

While conducting training exercises 80 miles off Okinawa, an A4 strike aircraft is loaded with a B43 hydrogen bomb, but it falls overboard and sinks in 16,000 feet of water. Based on the true story of the USS Ticonderoga, which reached Japan two days later (on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor; nice touch). Neither side revealed the incident, nor that she was carrying atomic weapons in contravention of U.S. treaties with Japan. The plane, its pilot, and the bomb were never recovered, and the incident was only declassified in 1989, causing an outcry in Japan and resulting in this environmentally themed anime. The extra \"n\" in Ticonderonga may be a genuine error in transcription or an attempt to distance the story from real events, since the anime continues with Ashika, a boy from a Japanese fishing town, contacted by telepathic whales who bring him visions of fearful seamonsters. Then again, if you were a whale given a choice between nuclear contamination and talking to Japanese fishermen, which would you choose?\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":26235,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26235/Crayon_no_Hoshi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/66165l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Crayon no Hoshi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"クレヨンの星"}],"title":"Crayon no Hoshi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"クレヨンの星","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1991},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1991"},"duration":"14 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":16075,"popularity":19596,"members":194,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"An educational film about a teamwork.

The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \"symphonic poem\" or \"tone poem\" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\n\nTomita's symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\n\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza's capture and Panja's death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem's animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\n\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"},{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":12401,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12401/The_Gakuen_Choujo-tai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"The Gakuen Choujo-tai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Za Gakuen Choujotai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"School Super Girl Team"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ザ・学園超女隊"},{"type":"English","title":"The Chohjotai"}],"title":"The Gakuen Choujo-tai","title_english":"The Chohjotai","title_japanese":"ザ・学園超女隊","title_synonyms":["Za Gakuen Choujotai","School Super Girl Team"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1991-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":6,"year":1991},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 27, 1991"},"duration":"45 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":5.71,"scored_by":330,"rank":10550,"popularity":12574,"members":1119,"favorites":2,"synopsis":"Yumi, O-Kei, and Mai are students at Yamashiro High School.
