It was broadcast by Fuji Television and aired on Tuesdays when broadcast began in 1963. The first episode debuted on New Year's Day with a 27.4% viewership rating, with the series later peaking at over 40% rating by the following year. From 1964 onward, the airing was changed to Saturdays. When American television producer the late Fred Ladd helped NBC Enterprises adapt the series for broadcast in the United States in 1963, the title Astro Boy was used instead of the manga's English title Mighty Atom. The change was forced because of its similarity to the contemporary American superhero character Mighty Mouse, which Osamu Tezuka used as a basis for the character Atom.","season":"winter","year":1963,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1403,"type":"anime","name":"Meiji Seika","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1403/Meiji_Seika"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Mushi Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":6535,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6535/Ai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/64699l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ai"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"愛"},{"type":"English","title":"Love"}],"title":"Ai","title_english":"Love","title_japanese":"愛","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1963-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1963},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1963"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":4.19,"scored_by":2474,"rank":13098,"popularity":8753,"members":4168,"favorites":5,"synopsis":"A short experimental anime about a woman desperately in love.

A decade later criminals discovered two of the surviving prototypes, #26 and 27 in the series, and used the remote controlled robots to commit a number of crimes. Young Shotaro Haneda, the twelve year old son of Dr.Haneda, did some investigating and discovered that the mob were hunting for the twenty-eighth robot in the series, rumoured to be the most powerful of them all. Racing the villains, Shotaro discovers the robot first, along with Dr.Shikashima, a colleague of his father's who was also believed killed by the Allied bombing. Together the two prevent Tetusjin-28 (the robot's official designation) from falling into the hands of the bad guys, and decide to dedicate him to peace rather than war.\n\nShotaro fought crime for a long time, supported by Dr.Shikashima, who would repair Tetsujin-28 when he was damaged, and by police officer Otsuka. Shotaro even battled the alien Magmans, invaders from the planet Magma, who came to Earth late in his career, bringing their own giant robots, Magma X and Gold Wolf, with them.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1963,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":191,"type":"anime","name":"Eiken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/191/Eiken"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":5052,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5052/Eightman","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/73670l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Eightman"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Eight Man"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Eitoman"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"8man"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tobor the Eighth Man"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"エイトマン"},{"type":"English","title":"8 Man"}],"title":"Eightman","title_english":"8 Man","title_japanese":"エイトマン","title_synonyms":["Eight Man","Eitoman","8man","Tobor the Eighth Man"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":56,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1963-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1964-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":11,"year":1963},"to":{"day":24,"month":12,"year":1964}},"string":"Nov 7, 1963 to Dec 24, 1964"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6,"scored_by":522,"rank":9268,"popularity":10989,"members":1959,"favorites":4,"synopsis":"A private investigator working a routine case involving stolen technology is mortally wounded.
