This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.\n\nDue to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.\n\nBullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":484,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyopop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/484/Tokyopop"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"Delinquents","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/55/Delinquents"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":781,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/781/Detective_Conan_Movie_03__The_Last_Wizard_of_the_Century","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1831/94317l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Detective Conan Movie 03: The Last Wizard of the Century"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Meitantei Conan: Seikimatsu no Majutsushi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Detective Conan Movie 3"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"名探偵コナン 世紀末の魔術師"},{"type":"English","title":"Case Closed Movie 3: The Last Wizard of the Century"},{"type":"German","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 3: Der Magier des letzten Jahrhunderts"},{"type":"French","title":"Détective Conan Film 3: Le Magicien de la fin du siècle"}],"title":"Detective Conan Movie 03: The Last Wizard of the Century","title_english":"Case Closed Movie 3: The Last Wizard of the Century","title_japanese":"名探偵コナン 世紀末の魔術師","title_synonyms":["Meitantei Conan: Seikimatsu no Majutsushi","Detective Conan Movie 3"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1999-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":4,"year":1999},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 17, 1999"},"duration":"1 hr 40 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.03,"scored_by":39212,"rank":571,"popularity":2623,"members":64682,"favorites":77,"synopsis":"Kaitou Kid dares to challenge the police once more, setting his sights on the Russian Imperial Easter Egg.

Gokudou does get his wishes, though not exactly in the fashion that he expected.

Shortly after, Hamtarou is revealed to be hiding under Natsumi's blanket, where he introduces himself to the viewer.\n\nHamuchanzu Corner ~ Biscuits in the Vase (ハムちゃんずコーナー ~ つぼの中のビスケット): Hamtarou and the Ham-Hams help Bijou retrieve a biscuit she had dropped while running on the roof posts. After multiple attempts to retrieve the cookie fail, Hamtarou suggests that he be lowered down into the vase, like a prize-catching crane machine. With this plan, Hamtarou is able to retrieve Bijou's biscuit. The vase wobbles and he begins to fall, but the dog wakes up and rescues the hamster by catching him with a pillow. With Hamtarou saved, Bijou hugs Hamtarou graciously and the episode ends as Hamtarou watches the dog slip away to go back to sleep.\n\nI Love You, Natsumi-chan (ドラマ ~ 大好き、なつみちゃん): The episode opens with Hamtarou having a bit of a manly montage; he seems like he has something important to do. Before she leaves for school, Natsumi tells Hamtarou she likes him while petting him. In response, without her understanding, Hamtarou confesses to Natsumi that he loves her romantically, but knows that Natsumi only loves him as a companion. She then has to leave for school and meets her classmate, Shirohara, to walk with him. Hamtarou wishes to become rivals with the schoolboy, who he knows Natsumi has a crush on. He spends the day venting and whining to Wanta about how Shirohara has beaten him for Natsumi's affection, and eventually tires himself out. At the end of the day, however, Natsumi tells Hamtarou that she loves him very much, which makes him very happy.\n\nHamuchanzu Corner ~ Yellow Happiness (ハムちゃんずコーナー ~ 黄色いしあわせ): Hamtarou and the Ham-Hams appear to be on a scheme to get some sunflower seeds.\n\n(Source: Wikia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":9503,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9503/Hokenshitsu_de_Aimashou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1824/104001l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hokenshitsu de Aimashou"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"保健室で逢いましょう"}],"title":"Hokenshitsu de Aimashou","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"保健室で逢いましょう","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1999-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":8,"year":1999},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 27, 1999"},"duration":"40 min","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":4.84,"scored_by":246,"rank":null,"popularity":12695,"members":1080,"favorites":0,"synopsis":null,"background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1161,"type":"anime","name":"Allure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1161/Allure"},{"mal_id":1424,"type":"anime","name":"Mediabank","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1424/Mediabank"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5587,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5587/Shin_Reyon_Densetsu__Mou_Hitori_no_Flair","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/113163l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shin Reyon Densetsu: Mou Hitori no Flair"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"新リヨン伝説　もう一人のフレア"}],"title":"Shin Reyon Densetsu: Mou Hitori no Flair","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"新リヨン伝説　もう一人のフレア","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1999-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":7,"year":1999},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 16, 1999"},"duration":"39 min","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":5.11,"scored_by":315,"rank":null,"popularity":12772,"members":1055,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"An evil entity named Ternel has returned after being sealed away for 300 years, and she intends to continue to inflict suffering as well as unworldly pleasures on mankind.

In June 2004, One Piece was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment, which partnered with Viz Media for home video distribution. As One Piece proved unsuitable for their target demographic, 4Kids Entertainment censored the show to meet their standards, and, in December 2006, they stopped its production. In April 2007, Funimation took over the series licensing, providing an uncut version that remained faithful to the original release. In Japan, the anime's first 574 episodes were released exclusively on DVD by Avex Pictures from February 21, 2001, to December 4, 2013. Blu-rays also became available with the DVDs starting on January 8, 2014. In North America, Viz Media released the anime on DVD between February 28, 2006, and June 26, 2007. Funimation has re-released and continued the series since May 27, 2008. From March 23, 2021, the DVDs were accompanied by Blu-rays as well.","season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"09:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 09:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":416,"type":"anime","name":"TAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/416/TAP"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":252,"type":"anime","name":"4Kids Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/252/4Kids_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":136,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/136/Hunter_x_Hunter","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/132237l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hunter x Hunter"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"HxH"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"HUNTER×HUNTER（ハンター×ハンター）"},{"type":"English","title":"Hunter x Hunter"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Hunter X Hunter: Cazadores de Tesoros"}],"title":"Hunter x Hunter","title_english":"Hunter x Hunter","title_japanese":"HUNTER×HUNTER（ハンター×ハンター）","title_synonyms":["HxH"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":62,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1999-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2001-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":10,"year":1999},"to":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":2001}},"string":"Oct 16, 1999 to Mar 31, 2001"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.41,"scored_by":281138,"rank":174,"popularity":361,"members":576557,"favorites":10698,"synopsis":"Hunters are specialized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from treasure hunting to cooking.

This second adaptation follows the achievements of Yang Wen-li of the Free Planets Alliance before the fateful Battle of Astarte, and continues the tales of Reinhard von Müsel and Siegfried Kircheis of the Galactic Empire.\n\nSpiral Labyrinth\nYang is propelled to the spotlight after his famous evacuation of civilians from El Facil. Following an unofficial double promotion and a flurry of media attention, he chronicles his research of the Year 730 Mafia—a close-knit group of Alliance military officers centered around the famed tactician Bruce Ashbey. He investigates a startling claim by Ashbey's deceased widow that may have enormous political ramifications: that the great war hero was not killed in action but murdered.\n\nThe Mutineer\nReinhard and Kircheis are posted on the destroyer Hameln II, docked at Iserlohn Fortress. After gaining the respect of the crew, Reinhard's leadership is tested when the captain is severely wounded and passes command authority to Reinhard, the next-highest ranking officer on deck.\n\nThe Duelist\nWhile Reinhard and Kircheis are working in the Imperial capital Odin, Reinhard learns of a mining rights dispute involving Dorothea von Schaffhausen, a friend of his sister Annerose von Grünewald. Upon hearing that Count Herxheimer intends to settle the matter with a duel, Reinhard volunteers to represent the Schaffhausen family.\n\nThe Retriever\nAfter falling out of favor with the nobility, Count Herxheimer is trying to escape to the Free Planets Alliance with a stolen Seffle particle generator prototype. Reinhard is tasked with retrieving both the prototype and the defector, but is only assigned the cruiser Hässliche Entlein due to the confidential nature of the mission.\n\nThe Third Battle of Tiamat\nTo commemorate the 30th year of the reign of Kaiser Friedrich IV, the Empire announces a large-scale military campaign against the Free Planets Alliance. In the ensuing clash between the Imperial expeditionary force and three Alliance fleets, Reinhard's timely intervention shapes the tides of war.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"},{"mal_id":905,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/905/Tokuma_Japan"},{"mal_id":2434,"type":"anime","name":"Wright Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2434/Wright_Staff"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1269,"type":"anime","name":"K-Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1269/K-Factory"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1018,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1018/Majutsushi_Orphen__Revenge","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/61841l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Majutsushi Orphen: Revenge"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Revenge"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"魔術士オーフェンRevenge"},{"type":"English","title":"Orphen 2: Revenge"}],"title":"Majutsushi Orphen: Revenge","title_english":"Orphen 2: Revenge","title_japanese":"魔術士オーフェンRevenge","title_synonyms":["Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Revenge"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":23,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1999-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2000-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":10,"year":1999},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2000}},"string":"Oct 2, 1999 to Mar 25, 2000"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.76,"scored_by":7178,"rank":5226,"popularity":4895,"members":18249,"favorites":24,"synopsis":"Orphen and his gang has set out on an all new adventure with many monsters to battle and no peace and quiet.
