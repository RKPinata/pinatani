Once brought together, these objects form The Holy Grail, a magical relic with extraordinary abilities. They want to use the Grail to save the world, but an evil organization known as the Death Busters seeks its power for their own desires.\n\nThe removal of a Talisman from a person's Heart Crystal will cause their death, something that Uranus and Neptune see as a necessary sacrifice to form the Grail, while Sailor Moon and her group deem it unforgivable.

After receiving an ominous message about the Wind Crystal, Hassam travels to the Wind Temple. Concerned for his safety, Linaly suggests that they make the journey together. On their trip, they encounter Prettz, a rowdy yet amiable swordsman, who is captivated by the young girl and accompanies the duo for his own mysterious reasons.\n\nDuring a battle, an antlion monster injures Hassam, leaving him bedridden. As a result, the responsibility of securing the Wind Crystal falls on Linaly, with Prettz assuming the role of her guardian as they continue their perilous adventure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1447,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Vision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1447/Urban_Vision"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":103,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/103/Akazukin_Chacha","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1098/108972l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Akazukin Chacha"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"赤ずきんチャチャ"},{"type":"English","title":"Red Riding Hood Chacha"}],"title":"Akazukin Chacha","title_english":"Red Riding Hood Chacha","title_japanese":"赤ずきんチャチャ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":74,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1994-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1995-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":1994},"to":{"day":30,"month":6,"year":1995}},"string":"Jan 7, 1994 to Jun 30, 1995"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.51,"scored_by":5445,"rank":1740,"popularity":5223,"members":15294,"favorites":117,"synopsis":"Akazukin Chacha is the story of a young magical girl (Mahō Shōjo) named Chacha. Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy.\n\nThe first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team. Most of the stories in season 3 are based on the manga.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1994,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":2725,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2725/Tenchi_Muyou__Galaxy_Police_Mihoshi_Space_Adventure","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1274/94457l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tenchi Muyou!: Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tenchi Muyo!

One of these sacrifices is that the room for nature and wildlife to flourish will decrease significantly over time. As this decline continues, many animal communities experience the brunt of urbanization. One such community known as the \"Tanuki,\" a type of magical shape-shifting mammal, is caught up in a struggle to defend their beloved forest from being absorbed by the looming threat of an expanding Tokyo.\n\nAs more and more Tanuki find themselves with nowhere to hide and territorial fights become increasingly regular amongst the different factions of the community, the elder Tanuki Oroku decides that something must be done. For the sake of their home as well as the safety of their future generations, the Tanuki unite as one with the hope that together they may be able to repel mankind's construction projects and scare them away from the forests using their shapeshifting abilities.\n\nBut as they begin their first attempts at sabotage, the Tanuki soon realize the operation will be no easy task.

They crash into a black hole which is connected to another universe. The people on the ship are cast adrift in an emergency capsule to a planet called Ismo. The story begins 12 years after they have reached Ismo.\n\nIsmo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System.\n\nThere were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the time of the gods, there was a war against the evil monster Yamatano Orochi (an 8-headed snake-like creature). The gods won the battle. Yamatano Orochi was locked into 8 stones, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.\n\nA million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi. Susanoo stands up to protect his friends and their planet.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1994,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4023,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4023/Kittys_Paradise","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29203l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kitty's Paradise"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"キティズパラダイス"},{"type":"English","title":"Hello Kitty's Paradise"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Hello Kitty's Paradise"},{"type":"French","title":"Le Paradis d'Hello Kitty"}],"title":"Kitty's Paradise","title_english":"Hello Kitty's Paradise","title_japanese":"キティズパラダイス","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":16,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1994-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1994-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":4,"year":1994},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":1994}},"string":"Apr 6, 1994 to Sep 28, 1994"},"duration":"8 min per ep","rating":"G -

M. Bison's plan to crush those who would oppose his organization, Shadowloo, is simple: brainwash the strongest martial artists around with his dreaded psycho power, and turn them into living weapons! To stop him, Interpol agent Chun-Li must team up with Major Guile of the United States Air Force, but that's no small feat.\n\nThey'll have to put aside their differences and learn to work together, and fast.
