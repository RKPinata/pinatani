Confused by this unexpected turn of events, the Hero refuses to ally himself with his enemy, claiming that the war the demons have waged is tearing the Southern Nations apart.\n\nHowever, the Demon Queen rebuts, arguing that the war has not only united humanity but has also brought them wealth and prosperity, providing evidence to support her claims. Furthermore, she explains that if the war were to end, the supplies sent by the Central Nations in aid to the Southern Nations would cease, leaving hundreds of thousands to starve. Fortunately, she offers the Hero a way to end the war while bringing hope not only to the Southern Nations, but also to the rest of the world, though she will need his assistance to make this a reality.\n\nFinally convinced, the Hero agrees to join his now former enemy in her quest.

Though undoubtedly a skilled warrior, Ross is actually both sarcastic and sadistic, and hence revels in Alba's suffering. \n\nSenyuu. is a comedic adventure following the unlikely duo as they struggle in their endeavor to defeat the demon lord, meeting various eccentrics along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2013,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":271,"type":"anime","name":"Barnum Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/271/Barnum_Studio"},{"mal_id":715,"type":"anime","name":"Dwango","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/715/Dwango"},{"mal_id":1261,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":334,"type":"anime","name":"Ordet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/334/Ordet"},{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":15613,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15613/Hakkenden__Touhou_Hakken_Ibun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/43007l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ZPnQQxQRPZE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPnQQxQRPZE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPnQQxQRPZE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZPnQQxQRPZE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZPnQQxQRPZE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZPnQQxQRPZE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZPnQQxQRPZE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZPnQQxQRPZE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"八犬伝 -東方八犬異聞-"},{"type":"English","title":"Hakkenden -Eight Dogs of the East-"},{"type":"German","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of The East"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of The East"},{"type":"French","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of The East"}],"title":"Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun","title_english":"Hakkenden -Eight Dogs of the East-","title_japanese":"八犬伝 -東方八犬異聞-","title_synonyms":["Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":1,"year":2013},"to":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":2013}},"string":"Jan 6, 2013 to Mar 31, 2013"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.39,"scored_by":42866,"rank":2204,"popularity":1835,"members":113445,"favorites":699,"synopsis":"The village of Ootsuka—home to Shino Inuzuka, Sousuke Inukawa, and Hamaji—was lit on fire under the preconception that a virus had seen all of its life eradicated.

Unfortunately, half-human criminals means non-human clues that often leave the police stumped. That's where lone wolf detectives like Hiroshi Inaba come in. He's literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone's hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn't complaining much.) And it's nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba's nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba's sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he's going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat.

Unfortunately, now a shy and timid first-year high school student, Aoi has become so absorbed in these pastimes that she can barely socialize with others, leaving her practically friendless. It is only when she runs into the lively Hinata Kuraue, an old friend from her climbing days, that things start to change. \n\nImpulsive and high-spirited, Hinata insists on having Aoi join her in all sorts of climbing activities. Though reluctant at first, Aoi quickly finds that her time with Hinata brings back fond memories of their childhood and soon decides to start climbing again. As the return to her past hobby starts to bring her out of her shell, Aoi finds herself gaining close friends, taking on new challenges, and continuing to find her own encouragement to climb.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Yama no Susume adapts the 1st volume and part of the 2nd volume of siro's manga series of the same title.","season":"winter","year":2013,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":925,"type":"anime","name":"Earth Star Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/925/Earth_Star_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":441,"type":"anime","name":"8bit","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/441/8bit"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":14515,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/14515/Sasami-sanGanbaranai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53951l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"dqWuzYhQ-OE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqWuzYhQ-OE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqWuzYhQ-OE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dqWuzYhQ-OE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dqWuzYhQ-OE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dqWuzYhQ-OE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dqWuzYhQ-OE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dqWuzYhQ-OE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Sasami-san@Ganbaranai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sasami-san at Ganbaranai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sasami-san@Unmotivated"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ささみさん@がんばらない"}],"title":"Sasami-san@Ganbaranai","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ささみさん@がんばらない","title_synonyms":["Sasami-san at Ganbaranai","Sasami-san@Unmotivated"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":1,"year":2013},"to":{"day":29,"month":3,"year":2013}},"string":"Jan 11, 2013 to Mar 29, 2013"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.66,"scored_by":27688,"rank":5774,"popularity":2273,"members":81556,"favorites":142,"synopsis":"The Japanese call them hikikomori—people who've become so withdrawn socially that they refuse to leave their homes for weeks and even months at a time.

Fortunately though, she lives with her older brother Kamiomi, who just happens to be a teacher at the school Sasami is supposed to attend. Not to mention, her \"Brother Surveillance Tool\" which lets her view the outside world via her computer and will, theoretically, allow her to readjust to interfacing with people again. What it mainly does, however, is let her view her brother's interactions with the three very odd Yagami sisters, who inexplicably seem to have had their ages reversed and have various types of \"interest\" in Kamiomi. And then things start to get really weird... Magical powers? Everything turning into chocolate? Is life via the web warping Sasami's brain, or is it the universe that's going crazy?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2013,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":15195,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15195/Hetalia__The_Beautiful_World","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46073l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"0jVBDHPnoWA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jVBDHPnoWA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jVBDHPnoWA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jVBDHPnoWA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jVBDHPnoWA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jVBDHPnoWA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jVBDHPnoWA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jVBDHPnoWA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hetalia: The Beautiful World"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ヘタリア The Beautiful World"},{"type":"English","title":"Hetalia: The Beautiful World"}],"title":"Hetalia: The Beautiful World","title_english":"Hetalia: The Beautiful World","title_japanese":"ヘタリア The Beautiful World","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Web manga","episodes":20,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":1,"year":2013},"to":{"day":21,"month":6,"year":2013}},"string":"Jan 25, 2013 to Jun 21, 2013"},"duration":"5 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.42,"scored_by":34014,"rank":2077,"popularity":2480,"members":70661,"favorites":569,"synopsis":"Few people wonder what occurs between warring nations when they are not fighting each other.

An angler fish came there. The moon explained why he fell into the sea, but the angler fish did not hear the story because he was absorbed in fishing. Eating a fish, he went away. A shark came next. He tried to take the moon to the sky, but he got too tired partway and left the moon. Crabs came. They carried the moon to the beach, because they needed the light of a full moon to lay their eggs. When they finished laying their eggs, they went home. The moon left alone on the beach was washed away by the waves and returned into the sea. The moon rolled down a hill and fell on a turtle. It was a very old turtle who should know a lot. The moon asked him how to go back to the sky. The turtle asked a ray in the sand to take the moon with him. The ray took the moon with him and dropped the moon in the deepest sea. The moon sank deeper and deeper. There was a big fish in the bottom of the sea. Wrapped in particles of light coming out from the mouth of the big fish, the moon emerged on the surface of the sea and melted.\n\nDid the moon return to the sky? This animation can be interpreted differently by different viewers. It can be interpreted, for example, as a story of the moon that fell into the sea whether in reality or in a dream, or as a story of an old moon that had to die for the birth of a new moon, or as a story of a soul heading for heaven. Whatever interpretation viewers make, the story conveys a positive message that we are all allowed to exist. Represented by this animation is a small world gently embracing us all -- transient existence...\n\n(Source: YouTube)","background":"Winner of the 2013 Oofuji Noburou Award at the Mainichi Film Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":31832,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31832/Zawazawa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82265l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Zawazawa"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ZAWAZAWA"}],"title":"Zawazawa","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ZAWAZAWA","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":2013},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"2013"},"duration":"1 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":4.36,"scored_by":500,"rank":13057,"popularity":13596,"members":837,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Short animation by Komazaki Tomomi.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":42380,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42380/Re_I_Am","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1381/108366l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Re:I Am"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"RE:I AM"}],"title":"Re:I Am","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"RE:I AM","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Music","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":3,"year":2013},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 20, 2013"},"duration":"6 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.18,"scored_by":390,"rank":null,"popularity":13771,"members":796,"favorites":2,"synopsis":"Music video for the title track RE:I AM by Japanese singer Aimer that was on her 5th single.

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from the first eight volumes of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.

He discovers a mysterious girl at its source, who is revealed to be a \"Spirit,\" an otherworldly entity whose appearance triggers a spatial quake. Soon after, he becomes embroiled in a skirmish between the girl and the Anti-Spirit Team, a ruthless strike force with the goal of annihilating Spirits.\n\nHowever, there is a third party that  believes in saving the spirits: \"Ratatoskr,\" which surprisingly is commanded by Shidou's little sister!  Kotori forcibly recruits Shidou after the clash, presenting to him an alternative method of dealing with the danger posed by the Spirits—make them fall in love with him. Now, the fate of the world rests on his dating prowess, as he seeks out Spirits in order to charm them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Date A Live adapts the first 4 novels of Koushi Tachibana's light novel series of the same name.

Now that he has left this embarrassing phase behind, he does his best to avoid standing out and live a peaceful life, although he feels the world has become quite dull. But when he makes his way back to school one night to grab a textbook he left in class, he runs into a strange girl wearing a costume.\n\nThis girl, Ryouko Satou, happens to be his classmate and is affected by the exact same condition that he once had, holding on to a delusion that she is someone else and dressing up to reflect this. The very next day, Ichirou is asked by his teacher to become friends with Ryouko, to which he adamantly refuses, unwilling to be reminded of his own history. When he sees that she is being bullied just as he once was, however, the boy makes it his responsibility to take care of her and break her free from that which what once plagued him—the perfect job for Maryuuin Kouga.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":711,"type":"anime","name":"Delfi Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound"},{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":15911,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15911/Yuyushiki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48747l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"MvrM1KUSf30","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvrM1KUSf30","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvrM1KUSf30?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MvrM1KUSf30/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MvrM1KUSf30/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MvrM1KUSf30/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MvrM1KUSf30/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MvrM1KUSf30/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yuyushiki"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Yuyu-shiki"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ゆゆ式"},{"type":"English","title":"Yuyushiki"}],"title":"Yuyushiki","title_english":"Yuyushiki","title_japanese":"ゆゆ式","title_synonyms":["Yuyu-shiki"],"type":"TV","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":4,"year":2013},"to":{"day":26,"month":6,"year":2013}},"string":"Apr 10, 2013 to Jun 26, 2013"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.36,"scored_by":39675,"rank":2359,"popularity":1912,"members":106755,"favorites":649,"synopsis":"The story follows the school life of the three girls, Yuzuko, Yukari, and Yui, who join their high school's Data Processing Club.

Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. The film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite – Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle. In 2014 it won the Animation of the Year during the Japan Academy Prize, the Best Animated Film during the National Board of Review and the Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media during the Satellite Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Disney Platform Distribution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Disney_Platform_Distribution"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":15039,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15039/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/49993l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"aTv79pJh_dw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTv79pJh_dw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTv79pJh_dw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aTv79pJh_dw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aTv79pJh_dw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aTv79pJh_dw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aTv79pJh_dw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aTv79pJh_dw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.

He incorporates a kamishibai, a traditional paper-scrolling device, to add visuals to his already demented narration.\n\nA series of short horror stories, Yami Shibai begins with a bachelor who, after moving into a new apartment, immediately starts sensing a malevolent glare being pressed into him.

Knowing that the process could take a while, Nagi chases Yamato out of the house. He receives a text from Kai, who asks him if he wants to meet up at the park. When Yamato arrives, it is revealed that the rundown park was where the two of them first talked and bonded for the first time. After bantering a bit, Kai asks Yamato why he, who had always seemed to be having fun with a large crowd around him, was always the first one at the park after school. Yamato admits that he used to feel like he was a chameleon; someone who didn't have his own personality and just changed himself to please others. Kai tells Yamato that he used to hate the town, but thanks to Yamato, he now finds it to be beautiful. Kai reassures him that he is his own person, and Yamato confesses that after he met Mei, he realized just how lonely he was. Kai later runs into Megumi at the bus stop. They start talking, and Kai tells her that he thinks she's cool for staying true to herself while modelling. Megumi snaps back at him, and Kai, offended, leaves. When Momo comes, Megumi regrets lashing out on Kai and later becomes embarrassed when Momo suggests that Megumi likes him. At Mei's house, the cookies are done and turn out to be delicious. Mei's mom shoos Mei and Yamato out of the house. Yamato hugs Mei and tells her he's glad she's with him. They watch the sunset together before continuing their walk, holding hands. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":"It was bundled with the limited edition version of the 11th volume of the manga.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":218,"type":"anime","name":"Zexcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":18055,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/18055/Hakkenden__Touhou_Hakken_Ibun_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50885l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"aLvFp4XGtAY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLvFp4XGtAY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLvFp4XGtAY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aLvFp4XGtAY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aLvFp4XGtAY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aLvFp4XGtAY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aLvFp4XGtAY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aLvFp4XGtAY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"八犬伝 -東方八犬異聞- 2"},{"type":"English","title":"Hakkenden -Eight Dogs of the East- Season 2"},{"type":"German","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East Staffel 2"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East Temporada 2"},{"type":"French","title":"Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East Saison 2"}],"title":"Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun 2nd Season","title_english":"Hakkenden -Eight Dogs of the East- Season 2","title_japanese":"八犬伝 -東方八犬異聞- 2","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":7,"year":2013},"to":{"day":29,"month":9,"year":2013}},"string":"Jul 7, 2013 to Sep 29, 2013"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.61,"scored_by":29000,"rank":1423,"popularity":2661,"members":62817,"favorites":211,"synopsis":"The journey to find all eight sacred gems continues, as Sousuke and Shino travel in search of the remaining gem holders.

She soon learns that the volatile capital city is a dangerous place to be in as she is ambushed by a pair of ronin while in the streets. Much to her horror, the ronin are slain right in front of her eyes by white-haired, red-eyed samurai, only to be quickly disposed of by three men from the Shinsengumi—a special police force who serve the shogun.\n\nAfter the incident, Chizuru finds herself being taken into custody by the Shinsengumi for further questioning. Upon learning that her missing father is also the same man they are searching for, the chief allows her to stay in their care while they look for his whereabouts. While working as an assistant for second-in-command Toshizou Hijikata, Chizuru slowly discovers just how connected the troubling political environment of Kyoto and the demonic-looking white-haired samurai are to her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hakuouki Movie 1: Kyoto Ranbu was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sentai Filmworks as Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom: Wild Dance of Kyoto on June 28, 2016.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]},{"mal_id":15883,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15883/Fantasista_Doll","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/52529l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"nsKeRDdCj7Y","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsKeRDdCj7Y","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsKeRDdCj7Y?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsKeRDdCj7Y/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsKeRDdCj7Y/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsKeRDdCj7Y/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsKeRDdCj7Y/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsKeRDdCj7Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fantasista Doll"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ファンタジスタドール"},{"type":"English","title":"Fantasista Doll"}],"title":"Fantasista Doll","title_english":"Fantasista Doll","title_japanese":"ファンタジスタドール","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2013-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":7,"year":2013},"to":{"day":29,"month":9,"year":2013}},"string":"Jul 7, 2013 to Sep 29, 2013"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.17,"scored_by":10416,"rank":8418,"popularity":4121,"members":26892,"favorites":20,"synopsis":"Uzume Uno is a young student and former champion of a trading card game competition.

After being brought into the household following the death of his parents, Mamoru vows to repay the kindness of his benefactors by serving as their loyal butler. His older sister, Kotone, is raised as an heiress of the family. Showered with love by their adoptive mother Saya and stepsister Ririko, the two could not be happier with their new lives.\n\nYet despite its elegant reputation, the Kamishiro household hides a dark secret: to sustain its vast fortune and influence, women of the family are required to participate in a ceremonial orgy known as the \"Feast.\" In this erotic ritual, men from all over the village pay a bountiful sum for a chance to bed these women. When the Kamishiro head, Ikki, is threatened with exile for being unable to bear an offspring with Saya, he declares the beginning of the next Feast to appease the villagers—with Kotone as the main offering.\n\nAs the night of the ritual draws near, Mamoru must do whatever it takes to protect the chastity of his beloved sister. Although she is prepared to carry out her duty as a maiden of the household, the defiant boy will ensure that none can bring harm to whom he loves most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Based on the erotic game developed by AliceSoft, released in 2012.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1374,"type":"anime","name":"Office Takeout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1374/Office_Takeout"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":19633,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/19633/Seikou__Osananajimi_wa_Terekusasou_ni_Uso_wo_Tsuku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/57161l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Seikou!: Osananajimi wa Terekusasou ni Uso wo Tsuku"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seikou!: Lose A Virgin For The First Term"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"せいこう！ ～幼なじみは照れくさそうに嘘をつく～"}],"title":"Seikou!: Osananajimi wa Terekusasou ni Uso wo Tsuku","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"せいこう！ ～幼なじみは照れくさそうに嘘をつく～","title_synonyms":["Seikou!: Lose A Virgin For The First Term"],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":9,"year":2013},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 20, 2013"},"duration":"17 min","rating":"Rx -

But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the \"Great Spiritual Disaster,\" an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day. As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world.\n\nNow, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology.

Despite not receiving clearance from Commander Erwin Smith, when a titan is spotted in nearby forestland, Hange rides out alone to meet it. Recklessly luring it out, she asks the titan numerous questions and puts her life on the line for the sake of her research. However, the behavior of this particular titan is far from normal. It quickly turns back and enters the wood once again, leading Hange to somewhere specific. What Hange finds is the legacy of former scout Ilse Langnar. In spite of her death, she provides a valuable piece of information that may serve to turn the tide for titan research—a diary documenting her last moments.\n\nTotsuzen no Raihousha: Sainamareru Seishun no Noroi\nJean Kirstein would do anything to escape his boring home life and overbearing mother. After enlisting in the military, it became his ultimate goal to join the Military Police regiment and live out in peace and luxury. However, during his time with the 104th Training Corps, things never really go the way Jean wants them to. Eventually, the stolen glory and condescending banter of his comrades become too much—and Jean challenges fellow cadet Sasha Blouse to a battle, in order to determine which of them is strongest—but who will come out on top?\n\nKonnan\nThe 104th Training Corps' most recent mission is a trek on horseback into the forest. Although a test of their ability to stay alert even in non-threatening situations, the task is boring and can lead to in-fighting. This is especially true for one of the groups, lead by Marco Bott. Some want to stay true to the mission they have been tasked with, and the rest would rather slack off, occupying themselves with more exciting activities. But when trouble strikes, they are completely unprepared.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The first Shingeki no Kyojin OVA, Ilse no Techou, is adapted from a side-story in the 5th volume of the Shingeki no Kyojin manga.

Now recruited into the ranks of SEES, he begins fighting alongside his comrades, as only they can protect humanity from Shadows and prevent the anomaly that is the Dark Hour.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":344,"type":"anime","name":"Atlus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/344/Atlus"},{"mal_id":870,"type":"anime","name":"Index","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/870/Index"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":18441,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/18441/Blood_Lad__Wagahai_wa_Neko_de_wa_Nai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52611l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Blood Lad: Wagahai wa Neko de wa Nai"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ブラッドラッド 我輩は猫ではない"},{"type":"English","title":"Blood Lad OVA"},{"type":"French","title":"Blood Lad OAV : Je ne suis pas un chat"}],"title":"Blood Lad: Wagahai wa Neko de wa Nai","title_english":"Blood Lad OVA","title_japanese":"ブラッドラッド 我輩は猫ではない","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2013-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":12,"year":2013},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 4, 2013"},"duration":"27 min","rating":"PG-13 -
