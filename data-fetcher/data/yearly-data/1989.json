This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\n\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Adapts chapters 195-519 of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball manga. The U.S. version is a dubbed alternative version of the original Japanese anime. For example, blood has been removed, beer is called root beer, the afterlife is called \"Another Universe,\" and people emigrate before cities are destroyed. The U.S. version edited and compiled the original for a reduced episode count of 276 instead of the original 291. The proper episode count was later restored on the uncut \"Orange Brick\" Season Set released by FUNimation Entertainment from 2006 to 2009. Additionally, these sets as well as the Season Set Blu-rays crop the show from its original 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9. The only complete 4:3 release ever released in English were the Dragon Boxes, which have long since gone out of print.","season":"spring","year":1989,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":210,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/210/Ranma_½","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/6441l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"bjnLpR_jdQo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnLpR_jdQo","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjnLpR_jdQo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bjnLpR_jdQo/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bjnLpR_jdQo/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bjnLpR_jdQo/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bjnLpR_jdQo/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bjnLpR_jdQo/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ranma ½"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ranma 1/2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ranma ½ Nettou Hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"らんま1/2"},{"type":"English","title":"Ranma ½"}],"title":"Ranma ½","title_english":"Ranma ½","title_japanese":"らんま1/2","title_synonyms":["Ranma 1/2","Ranma ½ Nettou Hen"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":161,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1989-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1992-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":4,"year":1989},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":1992}},"string":"Apr 15, 1989 to Sep 25, 1992"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.76,"scored_by":119233,"rank":1029,"popularity":935,"members":249654,"favorites":4057,"synopsis":"Ranma Saotome is a top-class martial artist and prodigy at the Saotome \"Anything-Goes\" school of martial arts.

From his father he inherited a love of baseball and an incredible talent for the sport, although both his mother and his older sister try to get him to give it up. \nHowever, before dying, his father had the time to teach him one last trick- a magic shot. After his mother gives him the glove his father used, Doumu makes that shot in a training session of the Giants and is contracted immediately. With the support of the veteran players of the team, the Giants become unbeatable at home- none of the main batters of the Japanese professional league can overcome his magic shot. However, away games are another matter, as Doumu is just allowed to play at home, in the Tokyo Dome in which his father was consecrated.\n New rivals, but also friends (such as Melody Norman, an American girl who disguises herself as a boy because women aren't allowed to play baseball), step up to bat along the way during Doumu's journey. The Giants seem to winning the fight to conquer the league- until the arrival of the mysterious Don Carlos, a Spanish ex-bullfighter who plays for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, and seems to have a past with Doumu's father. Will Doumu succeed in giving the league to the Giants? \n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1989,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4252,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4252/Explorer_Woman_Ray","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/56653l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Explorer Woman Ray"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"EXPLORER WOMAN RAY (エクスプローラーウーマン・レイ)"}],"title":"Explorer Woman Ray","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"EXPLORER WOMAN RAY (エクスプローラーウーマン・レイ)","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1989-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1989-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":5,"year":1989},"to":{"day":23,"month":6,"year":1989}},"string":"May 26, 1989 to Jun 23, 1989"},"duration":"30 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.26,"scored_by":617,"rank":12018,"popularity":11312,"members":1733,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"She's an archeologist AND a black belt and Ray Kazuki will need her brains and her brawn as she plunges into a thrill-filled adventure.

Ryo, however, is as indecisive as ever and so she leaves for Japan without him.\n  \nChuck Sweager, the third Borgman, is a police officer, as is his girlfriend Miki. When she witnesses a fight amongst several cyborgs she tells Chuck, who says flatly that it cannot be possible, since the only living cyborgs are Ryo, Anise, and himself. But she convinces him and they investigate. Anise arrives for her new job, and when they meet for dinner they explain the situation to her. Anise volunteers to sneak around the Heaven's Gate project, which they believe to be the source of these new cyborgs. Ryo, meanwhile, is en route to Japan to go after his girlfriend. Accompanying him is Hussan, one of the two surviving researchers on the Borgman Project, who has been asked to appear before the Tokyo Police to help investigate. Once the entire cast is in Japan, things begin to get complicated. \n\n(Source: ex.org)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":242,"type":"anime","name":"Ashi Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8226,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8226/Akuma-kun_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/21276l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Akuma-kun (Movie)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Devil Boy"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Akuma-kun (1989)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"悪魔くん"}],"title":"Akuma-kun (Movie)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"悪魔くん","title_synonyms":["Devil Boy","Akuma-kun (1989)"],"type":"Movie","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1989-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":7,"year":1989},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 15, 1989"},"duration":"40 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.99,"scored_by":330,"rank":9330,"popularity":12898,"members":1015,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"The age of the demons has begun.
