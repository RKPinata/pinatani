Tanpenshuu. Among the differences between the light novels and the anime series, the most notable are episodes 14 to 17, which are anime original stories. The series was initially scheduled to air on WOWOW before 2002, but it was postponed on account of the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks. ADV Films, the licensor for North America, released the anime on the Anime Network on demand between 2003 and 2004.

Suddenly, six additional copies of Nana appear, each possessing their own extreme personality and a crystal that grants them magic powers!\n\nWith her plans ruined, Nana vows to confess to her crush in her first year of high school.

Coming from a poor background, he can barely afford the expenses, let alone the newest fad: Persocoms, personal computers that look exactly like human beings. One evening while walking home, he finds an abandoned Persocom. After taking her home and managing to activate her, she seems to be defective, as she can only say one word, \"Chii,\" which eventually becomes her name. Unlike other Persocoms, however, Chii cannot download information onto her hard drive, so Hideki decides to teach her about the world the old-fashioned way, while studying for his college entrance exams at the same time.\n\nAlong with his friends, Hideki tries to unravel the mystery of Chii, who may be a \"Chobit,\" an urban legend about special units that have real human emotions and thoughts, and love toward their owner. But can romance flourish between a Persocom and a human? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The original episodes 9 and 18 are \"recap\" episodes, summarizing previous events.

But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a student's bike to avoid being late, so \"strange\" is a relative word.\n\nThere certainly isn't a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei's homeroom class. Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo's best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls—and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo's pigtails!\n\nTogether, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":170,"type":"anime","name":"Imagica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/170/Imagica"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"},{"mal_id":745,"type":"anime","name":"Cosmic Ray","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/745/Cosmic_Ray"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":48,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48/hack__Sign","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/94665l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"fPYF8rmP6Es","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPYF8rmP6Es","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPYF8rmP6Es?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fPYF8rmP6Es/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fPYF8rmP6Es/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fPYF8rmP6Es/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fPYF8rmP6Es/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fPYF8rmP6Es/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":".hack//Sign"},{"type":"Japanese","title":".hack//SIGN"},{"type":"English","title":".hack//Sign"}],"title":".hack//Sign","title_english":".hack//Sign","title_japanese":".hack//SIGN","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2002-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2002-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2002},"to":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":2002}},"string":"Apr 4, 2002 to Sep 26, 2002"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.95,"scored_by":83607,"rank":4336,"popularity":1272,"members":180599,"favorites":1366,"synopsis":"A young wavemaster, only known by the alias of Tsukasa, wakes up in an MMORPG called The World, with slight amnesia.

Her grandmother, who has a hatred of music, insists that Mitsuki undergo surgery to remove the cancer, but she refuses due to the risk of losing her voice. One day, two shinigami—Meroko Yui and Takuto Kira—appear to tell her that she only has one year left to live.

When she reaches home, she casually peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note, which says, \"If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (\"muglox\") will appear and grant your every wish.\" The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Yuuki, the class heartthrob. Suddenly, the adorable blue Mirumo appears! We soon find out, however, that this cute little muglox would rather eat chocolate and create mischief than help Kaede. \n\nMirumo, it seems, is prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rirumu, his princess bride-to-be, Mirumo has escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rirumu, Yashichi the bounty hunter, and a cast of hundreds of muglox ranging from the good to the bad to the nutty.

One day, she saves Prince Lune of the Cat Kingdom from being run over by a truck. As a token of gratitude, the Cat King sends her \"presents\" and invites her to the Cat Kingdom to become Lune's wife. Haru's inability to properly communicate with the cats leads to the misunderstanding that she has accepted the proposal.\n\nAs Haru ponders on ways to escape the predicament, a mysterious voice instructs her to search for the Cat Bureau. However, not long after she finally arrives at the bureau, a horde of cats swarms in and forcibly takes her to the Cat Kingdom, along with a member of the Cat Bureau. Concerned for their safety, owner of the Cat Bureau, Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, follows close behind.\n\nThe more Haru immerses herself in the activities of the Cat Kingdom, the more cat-like she becomes. To her dismay, she soon learns that, unless she can find her true self, she may become a cat permanently.

Having finally obtained permission to interview the retired starlet, an enamored Genya drags along cynical cameraman Kyouji Ida to meet her, ready to put his lifelong idol back in the spotlight once more.\n\nHidden in this secluded mountain retreat is a thousand years of history condensed into one lifetime, waiting to be narrated. Chiyoko's recollections take them on an illusionary journey through Japanese cinematic history that transcends the boundaries of reality; the saga of her acting career intertwines with her filmography, the actors in her life blend seamlessly with the characters on screen, and the present melds with the past. Though the actress may have retired at the height of her career 30 years ago, the curtain on her life's stage has yet to fall.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The film won the awards of Best Animation Film and Fantasia Ground-Breaker at the 2001 Fantasia Film Festival.

Despite their unexpected initial assaults, a combined effort by humanity not only pushed the JAM force off of Earth but also moved the frontlines of the battle onto the JAM's homeworld of Fairy. Though out of sight and mind for the majority of Earth's inhabitants, the conflict still rages on Fairy, where the United Nations has established five bases and a powerful, technologically advanced military—including the Fairy Air Force (FAF).\n\nLieutenant Rei Fukai acts as a pilot for the FAF Special Air Force’s Boomerang reconnaissance squadron, flying a Super Sylph fighter jet with the personal name \"Yukikaze.\" Soaring high above and observing the battles for air superiority, he is responsible for collecting and analyzing valuable intelligence on JAM methods. While his flying skills are unmatched, he also heavily relies on the highly advanced weaponry and near-sentient AI system of his aircraft. \n\nThough despised by other members of the FAF for his antisocial and standoffish nature, Lt. Fukai continues to carry out his duties along with Yukikaze. However, during a particularly bloody battle, the appearance of an unresponsive and hostile aircraft catches the lieutenant off-guard—an aircraft which is of the same make and model as his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Sentou Yousei Yukikaze won the Tokyo Anime Award in the OVA category in 2003 and 2006.

It’s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a “homeland” for hamsters called “Hamja Kingdom”. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom. When at last the hamsters reach the bustling Hamja Kingdom of hamsters, the popular King Hamja, the Mini-Hams that they’ve met before in Ham-Ham Land, and many jar spirits called the Mo-Hams appear. A parade begins merrily with singing and dancing! But, the bad magic cat “Sabakunya” appears suddenly, riding the giant sheep monster “Mee Mee”, and starts to trample the town. What a disaster! \n\nThe Ham-Hams flee underground. The Ham-Hams are told of the state of the Kingdom and find that Sabakunya has snatched the King’s daughter, Princess Shera, and is pressing her into marriage on the Kingdom’s Founding Day. Sabakunya is trying to take over the country. Something clicks in Hamtaro’s mind. Princess Shera is without a doubt the princess who appeared in his dreams!
