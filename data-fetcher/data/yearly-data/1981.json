Amamori Hajime is just a normal, everyday elementary school student, trying to study and hanging out with his crazy pals. But then one day as his father is testing a piece of equipment he has been working on, something causes it to blow up, taking the house with it! Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncle's observatory, he meets a girl he's seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, she's his uncle's assistant! What luck! \n\nBut Yayoi isn't exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamori-san at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen (Sen-Nen Joou), specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. \n\nHowever, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi?

Daicon III Opening Animation The 1981 Daicon III Opening Animation was solely animated by the three-person studio Daicon Film—consisting of university students Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Takami Akai. While others were involved in the short's production, there were only three members credited. Daicon IV Opening Animation The animation's unauthorized use of the Electric Light Orchestra song \"Twilight\" prevented it from receiving an official release; however, unofficial laserdiscs were produced to pay off the debt of the production. The production of the 1983 Daicon IV Opening Animation was said to be rigorous, and its completion was on the day of its premier. Nevertheless, the short's reception was overwhelmingly positive and spawned it a favorable legacy. A 2001 edition of the Animage magazine ranks both shorts at number 35 in its Top 100 anime productions ranking. The twelve individuals involved with the production of Daicon IV would go on to found the studio Gainax, responsible for the acclaimed anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Brief moments of Daicon IV can be seen in Gainax's anime Otaku no Video, which is based around the formation of the studio.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4936,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4936/Ninja_Hattori-kun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82502l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ninja Hattori-kun"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hattori the Ninja"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hattori"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"the Little Ninja"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ninja Hattori"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"忍者ハットリくん"},{"type":"English","title":"Ninja Hattori-kun"}],"title":"Ninja Hattori-kun","title_english":"Ninja Hattori-kun","title_japanese":"忍者ハットリくん","title_synonyms":["Hattori the Ninja","Hattori","the Little Ninja","Ninja Hattori"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":694,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1981-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1987-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":1981},"to":{"day":25,"month":12,"year":1987}},"string":"Sep 28, 1981 to Dec 25, 1987"},"duration":"10 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.93,"scored_by":6944,"rank":4432,"popularity":5945,"members":11054,"favorites":44,"synopsis":"The everyday Sanyo family gets an unexpected surprise in the shape of a new lodger-Hattori is a ninja boy who has come down from the Iga mountains to attend normal school.

It is a stroke of rare luck for Ataru that the duel is in fact a game of tag, and that his opponent is Lum, daughter of the Oni's leader, who places her personal dignity above victory—as Ataru finds out by seizing Lum's bikini top and with it, victory.\n\nHowever, misfortune kicks in again when Lum mistakes Ataru's promise to marry his girlfriend, Shinobu Miyake, as the desire to wed Lum herself, and decides she rather likes the idea. Wielding her influence as an alien princess, she moves in with him.
