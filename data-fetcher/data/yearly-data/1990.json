He and his veteran partner, Gina Marceau, slowly learn about the ever-fading line that separates man from machine.","background":"Initially planned for more episodes, production ceased after episode 3, due to the falling out between Artmic and Youmex.

The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\n\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons—in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\n\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort—Alwine's accomplice—who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert—a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.","background":null,"season":"summer","year":1990,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1475,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1475/City_Hunter__Bay_City_Wars","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1486/94388l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"City Hunter: Bay City Wars"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"シティーハンター ベイシティウォーズ"},{"type":"English","title":"City Hunter: Bay City Wars"},{"type":"German","title":"City Hunter Film 2: Bay City Wars"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"City Hunter Película 2: La Ciudad Portuaria en Guerra"},{"type":"French","title":"City Hunter Film 2: Bay City Wars"}],"title":"City Hunter: Bay City Wars","title_english":"City Hunter: Bay City Wars","title_japanese":"シティーハンター ベイシティウォーズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1990-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":8,"year":1990},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 25, 1990"},"duration":"45 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.34,"scored_by":3565,"rank":2442,"popularity":6692,"members":8288,"favorites":8,"synopsis":"After the US military ousts a sadistic Central-American tyrant, a spirit of merciless vengeance is born.

On his first day he is partnered up with John Estes, called Sleepy by his friends and Mad Bull by his enemies, a cop who stops crime with his own violent brand of justice. Mad Bull makes no qualms about executing common thieves with shotgun blasts if they even pose a minor threat to him or anyone around them. Mad Bull also often steals from prostitutes and does incredible amounts of property damage while fighting crime. Mad Bull's unpoliceman-like behavior often puts him in hot water with his partner Daizaburo and the 34th precinct. However, despite how reckless or illegal these acts are, a good cause is always revealed (For example, Sleepy uses the money he steals from the prostitutes to fund a venereal disease clinic and a home for battered and raped women). Perrine Valley, a police lieutenant, joins Daizaburo and Sleepy later on to help them tackle more difficult cases involving the mafia and drug-running.\n\nMad Bull 34 is inspired by the high-action buddy cop films of the '70s and '80s.\n\n(Source: Thevinnymac)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":207,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Bus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/207/Magic_Bus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1289,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1289/Kidou_Keisatsu_Patlabor__New_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/134832l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"HTkZPSmpFKY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTkZPSmpFKY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTkZPSmpFKY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HTkZPSmpFKY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HTkZPSmpFKY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HTkZPSmpFKY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HTkZPSmpFKY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HTkZPSmpFKY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: New OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Patlabor 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"機動警察パトレイバー　NEW OVA"},{"type":"English","title":"Mobile Police Patlabor: The New Files"}],"title":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: New OVA","title_english":"Mobile Police Patlabor: The New Files","title_japanese":"機動警察パトレイバー　NEW OVA","title_synonyms":["Patlabor 2"],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":16,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1990-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1992-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":22,"month":11,"year":1990},"to":{"day":23,"month":4,"year":1992}},"string":"Nov 22, 1990 to Apr 23, 1992"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.56,"scored_by":3577,"rank":1575,"popularity":6116,"members":10306,"favorites":35,"synopsis":"Special Vehicles Division 2 is back on duty, along with their Ingram Patrol Labor (Patlabor) robots.
