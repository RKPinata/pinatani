His grades are failing, and his father – traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) – is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \"I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.\"\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks – even to his own family – and the \"letters\" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he's delighted when his female pen pal says she'll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track.

This film is the first to feature anime original character Kinkotsu-Obaba. Although this film is set after the Golden Mask Arc, the character Geronimo does not appear as an active fighter until the next film. He does, however, appear in flashbacks to the Golden Mask conclusion. This is also the second time voice actor Ichirou Nagai appears in a Kinnikuman work playing the main villain. He had previously appeared in the TV Special. It also features the return of voice actors Kouzou Shioya and Yasuo Tanaka, who had previously appeared in the first film Stolen Championship Belt.

More emphasis was placed on entertainment factors than on theme, and this change in the concept line resulted in the withdrawal of Tezuka Productions Co., Ltd. from this series.\n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":14207,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/14207/Lovely_Series","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/110220l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Lovely Series"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ラブリー・シリーズ"},{"type":"English","title":"Lovely Series"}],"title":"Lovely Series","title_english":"Lovely Series","title_japanese":"ラブリー・シリーズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Unknown","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1985-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1985-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":7,"year":1985},"to":{"day":1,"month":11,"year":1985}},"string":"Jul 10, 1985 to Nov 1, 1985"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":4.64,"scored_by":229,"rank":null,"popularity":13655,"members":823,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"A 18+ restricted OVA, the third series produced by Fuji in 1985.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":509,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/509/Fuji_Video"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9390,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9390/Ginga_Hyouryuu_Vifam__Keito_no_Kioku_-_Namida_no_Dakkai_Sakusen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/59739l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam: Keito no Kioku - Namida no Dakkai Sakusen"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Galactic Drifter Vifam: Memory of Ms. Kate"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Round Vernian Vifam: Memory of Ms. Kate"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"銀河漂流バイファム ケイトの記憶 涙の奪回作戦!!"}],"title":"Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam: Keito no Kioku - Namida no Dakkai Sakusen","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"銀河漂流バイファム ケイトの記憶 涙の奪回作戦!!","title_synonyms":["Galactic Drifter Vifam: Memory of Ms. Kate","Round Vernian Vifam: Memory of Ms. Kate"],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1985-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":1985},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 25, 1985"},"duration":"57 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.4,"scored_by":262,"rank":7185,"popularity":13725,"members":807,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"The story takes place in Kukto in D.C. 2060 - a year after VIFAM.

Instead, the world is filled with ominous phenomena, including floating orbs populated with statues of goddesses, gargantuan army tanks that seem to move unmanned, armies of fishermen who chase after the shadows of nonexistent fish, and caverns solely decorated with glass vessels of water.\n\nIn this run-down world, a young girl takes care of a large egg and scavenges for food and drink. She encounters a mysterious man with a cross over his shoulder, who soon becomes curious about who she is and what her egg contains. They decide to explore the lost and broken landscape together, questioning each other about the nature of faith, the purpose of the world, and the origins of their lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When it was brought to the US, 45 minutes of live action footage was added in an attempt to release it as a post-apocalyptic thriller called In The Aftermath: Angels Never Sleep.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":488,"type":"anime","name":"Anchor Bay Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/488/Anchor_Bay_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":732,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/732/Vampire_Hunter_D","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1825/137673l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"mYWpTOBl3Ic","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWpTOBl3Ic","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYWpTOBl3Ic?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYWpTOBl3Ic/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYWpTOBl3Ic/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYWpTOBl3Ic/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYWpTOBl3Ic/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYWpTOBl3Ic/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Vampire Hunter D"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"吸血鬼〈バンパイア〉ハンターD"},{"type":"English","title":"Vampire Hunter D"}],"title":"Vampire Hunter D","title_english":"Vampire Hunter D","title_japanese":"吸血鬼〈バンパイア〉ハンターD","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1985-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":12,"year":1985},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 21, 1985"},"duration":"1 hr 20 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7,"scored_by":45762,"rank":4167,"popularity":2209,"members":85361,"favorites":347,"synopsis":"10,000 years in the future, the world has become a very different place; monsters roam the land freely, and people, although equipped with high tech weapons and cybernetic horses, live a humble life more suited to centuries past.
