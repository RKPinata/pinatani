Born August 11 1943, he was known as the director of several animations including VIFAM. Thus in 1998 a new TV series of VIFAM was broadcasted in memory of him. Televised 1998/3/21-1998/10/3 (in Kansai area), it contains 26 episodes, and like Twelve people disappeared it is a sidestory, but some new features are added: new persons, new RV, etc.\n\nThe story could be inserted between #22 and #26 (#24 and #25 are digests) of VIFAM, and is divided into three parts: Act I (#1-14), Interlude (#15-18), Act II (#19-26), if we name them (in reality Act I and II have little relationship). It could also be the New Testament, but it is now regarded as an apocrypha (or worse, a pseudo-VIFAM).

It was said that they lived in rivers and lakes. In fact, there were people who saw them. You can find Kappa as a subject in paintings, sculptures and stories. In the 20th century, Japan has become a highly industrialized country. Reclaimed lakes, rivers with concreted banks, large quantities of chemicals for the fields. Fish, insects, birds and animals lost their home. So did Kappa. This film depicts the waterside scene in Japan when Kappa lived vividly. We might have a chance to see them if we could prevent the further environmental pollution and make it easier for the other creatures to live.\n\n(Source: ASIFA-Japan)","background":"Winner of the 1998 Noburou Oofuji Award.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52268,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52268/An_Introduction_of_Human_Zoology","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1617/124898l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"An Introduction of Human Zoology"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"An introduction of human zoology"},{"type":"English","title":"An Introduction of Human Zoology"}],"title":"An Introduction of Human Zoology","title_english":"An Introduction of Human Zoology","title_japanese":"An introduction of human zoology","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1998},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1998"},"duration":"8 min","rating":null,"score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":15222,"popularity":21920,"members":83,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Short animation by Tomoyasu Murata.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":55124,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/55124/HOT_Ulideul-ui_Maengse","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1519/135531l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"H.O.T.

By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.\n\nSpike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.\n\nWhile developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"bJVyIXeUznY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVyIXeUznY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJVyIXeUznY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Trigun"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"トライガン"},{"type":"English","title":"Trigun"}],"title":"Trigun","title_english":"Trigun","title_japanese":"トライガン","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1998-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":4,"year":1998},"to":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":1998}},"string":"Apr 1, 1998 to Sep 30, 1998"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.21,"scored_by":364143,"rank":333,"popularity":248,"members":743335,"favorites":15530,"synopsis":"Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he's a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title \"The Humanoid Typhoon.\" He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.\n\nWith his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Japanese release by Victor Entertainment has different openings relating to the specific episode it's played on. The initial Geneon Entertainment USA (then known as Pioneer) releases on VHS and DVD (singles, Signature Series, and box set) used only the first opening on each episode. This was due to the Japanese licensor providing them clean materials for only the first opening to put the English credits on. Geneon later fixed this mistake on their Limited Edition tin releases in 2005/2006, as well as on the Remix singles. Following Geneon USA's demise in late 2007, the show went out of print. When FUNimation Entertainment picked up the show in 2010 and released it, they repeated Geneon's mistake of using only the first opening on every episode.

Little does DouDou know that this is part of the devil's plot to eat all of the ghosts.\n\n\"Grandma And Her Ghosts\" resembles the style and the touch of the great Hayao Miyazaki (\"My Neighbour Totoro\") with the strong root of the Taiwanese culture.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":35587,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35587/Boku_wa_Kimi_no_Namida","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85766l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Boku wa Kimi no Namida"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Minna no Uta"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I am your tears"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"僕は君の涙"}],"title":"Boku wa Kimi no Namida","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"僕は君の涙","title_synonyms":["Minna no Uta","I am your tears"],"type":"Music","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":6,"year":1998},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 1, 1998"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"G -

Lain has neither the desire nor the experience to handle even basic technology; yet, when the technophobe opens the email, it leads her straight into the Wired, a virtual world of communication networks similar to what we know as the internet. Lain's life is turned upside down as she begins to encounter cryptic mysteries one after another. Strange men called the Men in Black begin to appear wherever she goes, asking her questions and somehow knowing more about her than even she herself knows. With the boundaries between reality and cyberspace rapidly blurring, Lain is plunged into more surreal and bizarre events where identity, consciousness, and perception are concepts that take on new meanings.\n\nWritten by Chiaki J.

Negligent of the power they held, these beings ultimately caused their own demise.

Following ARCAM's recent discovery in the Ararat Mountains of what is believed to be the mythic Noah's Ark, Spriggan Yuu Ominae has been dispatched to investigate.\n\nHowever, the site is ambushed by the US Machine Corps—a radical faction of the Department of Defense led by Colonel MacDougall. On the Pentagon's orders, MacDougall seeks to secure ARCAM's lead scientist and seize the artifact. Teamed up with fellow Spriggan Jean Jacquemondo, Yuu must stop MacDougall and the Machine Corps' elite soldiers from advancing on the Ark before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"},{"mal_id":2229,"type":"anime","name":"Toho Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2229/Toho_Music"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Studio 4°C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/13/Studio_4%C2%B0C"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":10189,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10189/Hunter_x_Hunter_Pilot","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/122815l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hunter x Hunter Pilot"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハンターxハンター"}],"title":"Hunter x Hunter Pilot","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ハンターxハンター","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":7,"year":1998},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 26, 1998"},"duration":"25 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.21,"scored_by":12181,"rank":3091,"popularity":4031,"members":28256,"favorites":54,"synopsis":"The stand-alone pilot OVA which was shown as part of the \"Jump Super Anime Tour\" of 1998.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":2424,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2424/Suteki_desu_wa_Sakura-chan_Tomoyo_no_Cardcaptor_Sakura_Katsuyaku_Video_Nikki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68205l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Suteki desu wa, Sakura-chan!

Good at both academics and sports on top of being elegant and sociable, she has been an object of admiration all her life. However, in reality, she is an incredibly vain person who toils relentlessly to maintain her good grades, athleticism, and graceful appearance. She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praise—which is why she cannot stand Souichirou Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her. Since the first day of high school, she has struggled to steal the spotlight from her new rival but to no avail.\n\nAt last, on the midterm exams, Yukino gets the top score and beats Souichirou. But, to her surprise, he congratulates her on her achievement, leading her to question her deceptive lifestyle. When Souichirou confesses his love to Yukino, she turns him down and gloats about it at home with only a hint of regret. But the very next day, Souichirou visits Yukino house to bring her a CD and sees her uninhibited self in action; now equipped with the truth, he blackmails her into completing his student council duties.

A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies.

In the chaos, a boy named Tetsuro Daiba, who had lost his parents in the meteor hit, is paid a visit by Mello, a mysterious woman appearing in a bright light. When Daiba comes to, he finds himself in a spaceship infirmary under observation. Stealing a fighter that he didn't know how to pilot (until he tried it), he breaks out, flying like a total pro.\n\nHe was able to remember how to pilot from his DNA memory... and to find out more, his doctor friend takes him to his secret underground lab, in which he acts as a professor to find out ways to stop the traitor regime. When the forces invade to take him back, a girl named Rei Yuuki mysteriously shoots down their entire carrier with only a fighter jet! Apparently, both have mysterious powers that the enemies want, which may or may not be connected to their being the only two known survivors of the meteor impact.\n\nWhile looking for a third survivor (which turned out to be a cat), the two are taken by force to Queen Photon (ruler of the traitor regime), who claims that she is out to SAVE the Earth from those who sent the Meteor. The two don't know whether to believe her or Mello until the (telepathic) cat breaks them out of the Queen's sealed chamber, and Mello comes to straighten things out. That's when the two (er, three) of them make a choice... Stay on a planet that can't support their advanced race, or strike out into the unknown of space?\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1447,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Vision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1447/Urban_Vision"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3685,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3685/4-Day_Weekend","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81173l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"4-Day Weekend"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Four Day Weekend"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"4デイ・ウィークエンド"}],"title":"4-Day Weekend","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"4デイ・ウィークエンド","title_synonyms":["Four Day Weekend"],"type":"Music","source":"Music","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":18,"month":12,"year":1998},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 18, 1998"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.61,"scored_by":2023,"rank":null,"popularity":9423,"members":3283,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Music video for the song Four-Day Weekend by a British indie rock band The Bluetones from their album Return to the Last Chance Saloon.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Studio 4°C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/13/Studio_4%C2%B0C"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2781,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2781/Saint_Luminous_Jogakuin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1946/109012l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Saint Luminous Jogakuin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sei Luminous Jogakuin"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"聖ルミナス女学院"},{"type":"English","title":"St. Luminous Mission High School"}],"title":"Saint Luminous Jogakuin","title_english":"St. Luminous Mission High School","title_japanese":"聖ルミナス女学院","title_synonyms":["Sei Luminous Jogakuin"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1998-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":1998},"to":{"day":30,"month":12,"year":1998}},"string":"Oct 6, 1998 to Dec 30, 1998"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.91,"scored_by":864,"rank":9730,"popularity":9536,"members":3166,"favorites":5,"synopsis":"Kaihei is a rather normal high school student but soon discovers that his deceased grandfather has left him the chairman position of his all-girls high school, St. Luminous Mission High School.
