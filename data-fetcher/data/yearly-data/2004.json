Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.\n\nAs Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.\n\nWill the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The anime was awarded the Silver Prize in Animation Jury Award and Audience Award at Fantasia International Film Festival 2004 in Montreal, Canada.","season":"winter","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":33,"type":"anime","name":"WOWOW","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"},{"mal_id":517,"type":"anime","name":"Asmik Ace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/517/Asmik_Ace"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":801,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/801/Koukaku_Kidoutai__Stand_Alone_Complex_2nd_GIG","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/135390l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"D522fRIFfhI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D522fRIFfhI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D522fRIFfhI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/D522fRIFfhI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/D522fRIFfhI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/D522fRIFfhI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/D522fRIFfhI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/D522fRIFfhI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Koukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ghost In The Shell S.A.C. 2nd GIG"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"攻殻機動隊 S.A.C. 2nd GIG"},{"type":"English","title":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"},{"type":"German","title":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"},{"type":"French","title":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"}],"title":"Koukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG","title_english":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG","title_japanese":"攻殻機動隊 S.A.C. 2nd GIG","title_synonyms":["Ghost In The Shell S.A.C. 2nd GIG"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":2004},"to":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2005}},"string":"Jan 1, 2004 to Jan 8, 2005"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.52,"scored_by":102733,"rank":124,"popularity":1039,"members":223703,"favorites":3129,"synopsis":"Following the closure of the \"Laughing Man\" case, Section 9 is re-established by Japan's newly elected Prime Minister, Youko Kayabuki, to combat the persistent threat of cyber-terrorism.\n\nA group calling themselves \"The Individual Eleven\" has begun committing acts of terror across Japan.

That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\n\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.\n\nSet in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Samurai Champloo is the only anime to have featured music from the Japanese hip-hop producer Nujabes prior to his death in 2010.

His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.\n\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor.

Too bad Toudou Academy is the hardest possible place to realize their dreams. Their new high school is no ordinary academic institution. Rather than concentrating on classic subjects like math and science, Toudou Academy was created for the sole purpose of reviving the martial arts in Japan!\n\nAs a result, Souichiro's aspirations to become top dog are cut short when he runs afoul of Masataka Takayanagi and Maya Natsume.

After subduing the boy and his sister, Keroro plans to reunite with his comrades and return to the mothership to repair his invaluable invasion device, the Kero Ball.

However, once circumstances present her an opportunity to escape, Lucy, corrupted by the confinement and torture, unleashes a torrent of bloodshed as she escapes her captors.\n\nDuring her breakout, she receives a crippling head injury that leaves her with a split personality: someone with the mentality of a harmless child possessing limited speech capacity. In this state of instability, she stumbles upon two college students, Kouta and his cousin Yuka, who unknowingly take an injured fugitive into their care, unaware of her murderous tendencies. This act of kindness will change their lives, as they soon find themselves dragged into the shadowy world of government secrecy and conspiracy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Elfen Lied is based on Lynn Okamoto's seinen manga series of the same name and premiered while the manga was still in publication. The anime follows the source material through the first 7 volumes, with several alterations to the story, and concludes with an exclusive ending. In an interview, director Mamoru Kanbe expressed his disappointment in having to 'condense' to story into 13 episodes and felt that more were needed to include significant plot details that would have made the series more emotive. The artistic design of both the opening and ending sequences are heavily inspired by the works of Austrian symbolist painter . Colors and patterns resembling Klimt's distinct style were used and characters of the series were drawn to recreate several paintings from the artist’s golden period, including . The opening theme Lilium, which is sung in Ecclesiastical Latin, uses lyrics taken from The Bible, the Renaissance hymn Ave mundi spes Maria, as well as the alchemical compendium Theatrum Chemicum.","season":"summer","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":442,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/442/Naruto_Movie_1__Dai_Katsugeki_Yuki_Hime_Shinobu_Houjou_Dattebayo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1231/134484l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Naruto Movie 1: Dai Katsugeki!!

However, with the constant onslaught of alien invaders and the threat of imminent death, they must first focus on the task at hand—immediate survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Due to the ongoing serialization of the manga during the anime's production, Gantz 2nd Stage diverts from the manga's plotline midway and features an original ending.","season":"summer","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"10:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 10:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":59,"type":"anime","name":"High Stakes Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/59/High_Stakes_Game"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":241,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/241/Girls_Bravo__First_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/48027l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"fEOOnZ4NroI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEOOnZ4NroI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEOOnZ4NroI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fEOOnZ4NroI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fEOOnZ4NroI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fEOOnZ4NroI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fEOOnZ4NroI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fEOOnZ4NroI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Girls Bravo: First Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"GIRLSブラボー first season"},{"type":"English","title":"Girls Bravo"},{"type":"German","title":"Girls Bravo"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Girls Bravo"}],"title":"Girls Bravo: First Season","title_english":"Girls Bravo","title_japanese":"GIRLSブラボー first season","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2004-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2004-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2004},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2004}},"string":"Jul 5, 2004 to Sep 27, 2004"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.37,"scored_by":71529,"rank":7341,"popularity":1496,"members":147167,"favorites":317,"synopsis":"Small for his age, Yukinari has been bullied and abused by girls all his life.

Upon arriving there, Zuku is surprised to discover an unconscious young woman covered in a sparkling veil. Enticed by its splendid material, he snatches the fabric and attempts to flee. But its owner unexpectedly awakens, begging him to return the precious accessory.\n\nWith no other memory save for the veil's importance, the woman refuses to let Zuku leave without recovering it. Showing no remorse, the bandit violently renounces her plea—but little does he know, this unusual encounter will change his life forever. \n\nInspired by a renowned Japanese legend, Hi no Tori: Hagoromo-hen follows the intertwined fates of two individuals who learn to comfort one another amongst their troubles, illustrating the power of compassion and its ability to transform even the most bitter of hearts. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hi no Tori: Hagoromo Hen is a short anime adaptation of the \"Hagoromo-hen\" chapter from Osamu Tezuka's Hi no Tori manga. Translated in English by Viz under the title \"Robe of Feathers,\" this chapter is mostly inspired by Japan's famous eighth century Hagoromo legend. However, the adaptation's plot is slightly different from the manga's, especially with respect to the character Zuku. The movie was shown at the Tezuka Osamu World Cinema in Kyoto from July 17, 2004 until the theater was closed on January 16, 2011. The production team was almost identical to the Hi no Tori TV anime series' production team, but the voice actress of the Phoenix was changed.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1656,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1656/PostPet_Momobin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/112173l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"PostPet Momobin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Post Pet Momobin"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ポストペットモモ便"}],"title":"PostPet Momobin","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ポストペットモモ便","title_synonyms":["Post Pet Momobin"],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2004-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":7,"year":2004},"to":{"day":9,"month":1,"year":2005}},"string":"Jul 4, 2004 to Jan 9, 2005"},"duration":"3 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.29,"scored_by":168,"rank":11958,"popularity":15094,"members":540,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Momo and Komomo can deliver mail from anyone, to anyone.

It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.\n\nHowever, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town.

Although Hiroki and Takuya later learn about Sayuri's condition, they also discover that the girl's unconscious state is oddly linked to the same tower the trio had promised to conquer together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The film won the Best Animation Film award at the Mainichi Film Awards in 2004.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":291,"type":"anime","name":"CoMix Wave Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/291/CoMix_Wave_Films"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":482,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/482/Yu☆Gi☆Oh_Duel_Monsters_GX","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/20873l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yu☆Gi☆Oh!

Some say that the isle holds the secret of eternal youth; others believe that it brings disaster to their land. When Inuyasha's group saves a half-demon child from being hunted by a monstrous creature, they learn that her name is Ai and that she fled from Hourai. Surprisingly, the girl is an acquaintance of Inuyasha and begs him to rescue her friends, who are being held prisoner by vicious demons calling themselves the Four War Gods—an enemy Inuyasha remembers well.\n\nUpon reaching Hourai, Ai's guests are horrified to discover that only a handful of orphans still inhabit the island and are destined to become sacrifices to increase the Four War Gods' powers. Furthermore, the victims bear their oppressors' enchanted mark, which prevents them from escaping. Defeating the four demons remains Inuyasha's most viable option, but their superiority in strength will require daring initiatives achievable only by the group's combined teamwork.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"InuYasha Movie 4: Guren no Houraijima was released shortly after the InuYasha TV series' finale.

The latter was originally broadcasted at the Japanese radio show \"Anime Scramble,\" on December 10 and December 17, 2004. The English DVD was released by Viz Media on August 1, 2006 as both a single disc and one including a cell phone charm and a trading card. A limited-edition version followed on August 15, 2006, containing a lenticular card and an exclusive collector coin.
