But, a moment later, the red light returns and takes Yui away. \n\nDesperate to reunite with her companion, Miaka asks Tamahome for assistance. However, the situation escalates when the pair encounters the land's emperor, Hotohori, who believes Miaka is the foretold priestess of the kingdom's protector god Suzaku. By gathering the god's seven Celestial Warriors, the priestess can summon Suzaku and have all her wishes granted. Hotohori hopes this will save his country, and since it appears to be a fitting solution to the girl's problems as well, he convinces her to accept the role.\n\nMeanwhile, at the library, Yui realizes she has been brought back alone. Unable to intervene, she helplessly witnesses Miaka traversing through courageous trials as the mysterious book's heroine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Despite presenting some disturbing imagery, Fushigi Yuugi was broadcasted at 6 p.m. during its airing in Japan, a timeslot that now no longer permits such content.

It is the director's first work combining digital and hand-drawn animation. Originally aired as part of the duo's SUPER BEST3 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE tour in June 1995, the video was later shown alongside screenings of Mimi wo Sumaseba in theaters. It was also presented at the Mononoke Hime screening event in the US—which commemorated the 20th anniversary of the film's release—in 2017. The video was made available on VHS and Laserdisc by Pony Canyon on July 25, 1997. It was later included in the Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short compilation DVD, released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 16, 2005. Following the scandal of Aska being arrested for drug possession, Walt Disney Studios Japan removed On Your Mark from the Blu-ray and DVD box sets containing Hayao Miyazaki's works, which were released in July 2014, and also stopped the distribution of Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short. Studio Ghibli eventually decided to offer free individual Blu-rays of On Your Mark to all customers that had acquired box sets between October 2014 and October 2015.

This is just one of many ways that this peculiar ping-pong club exceeds the realm of normalcy.\n\nAmong the Ping-Pong Club's six members, Maeno proves to be the most troublesome, discovering bizarre ways to distract the team each day.

But when popular vice-captain Yuusuke Kinoshita is being swept away by girls, he instead finds himself receiving support from the stern but resilient manager, Kyoko.\n\nWith the ever-present risk of their team being dissolved, Takeda and his friends find themselves having to overcome numerous obstacles.

The Eto Rangers themselves are anthropomorphic animals, each representing one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals (and The Twelve Branches in Buddhism). In Japan they are known as the Eto animals. The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters.\n\nWhen a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (\"Jarei Shouran!\") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out \"Daikourin Kirinda!\" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out \"Jouka!\" (Purification).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3099,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3099/Juusenshi_Gulkeeva","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/52271l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Juusenshi Gulkeeva"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Wild Knights Gulkeeva"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Jusenshi Gulkeeva"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"獣戦士ガルキーバ"},{"type":"English","title":"Wild Knights Gulkeeva"}],"title":"Juusenshi Gulkeeva","title_english":"Wild Knights Gulkeeva","title_japanese":"獣戦士ガルキーバ","title_synonyms":["Wild Knights Gulkeeva","Jusenshi Gulkeeva"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1995-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1995-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":1995},"to":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":1995}},"string":"Apr 4, 1995 to Sep 26, 1995"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.34,"scored_by":473,"rank":7494,"popularity":10564,"members":2245,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"The world we live in is called Earthside in this story.

Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed \"Evangelions\" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.\n\nYears after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou's 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji's life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced.\n\nA devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father's dark machinations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Director Hideaki Anno's depression is what led to the dark themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Budgetary problems and parental complaints about content led to the original ending being scrapped and replaced with an extremely limited-animation ending breaking from the main plot. A movie, End of Evangelion, was later made based in part on the original planned ending and in part on Anno's increasing frustration with the otaku fanbase. The series' mix of psychoanalysis, religious symbolism, and genre deconstruction proved extremely influential on mature anime in the late '90s onward. The Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 ranked it as the most popular anime of all time.","season":"fall","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":1461,"type":"anime","name":"Audio Tanaka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1461/Audio_Tanaka"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"},{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":43,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Koukaku_Kidoutai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/82594l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"5GjS0Vvs8KA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GjS0Vvs8KA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GjS0Vvs8KA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5GjS0Vvs8KA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5GjS0Vvs8KA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5GjS0Vvs8KA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5GjS0Vvs8KA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5GjS0Vvs8KA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Koukaku Kidoutai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ghost in the Shell"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"GHOST IN THE SHELL（攻殻機動隊）"},{"type":"English","title":"Ghost in the Shell"},{"type":"German","title":"Ghost in the Shell"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Ghost in the Shell"},{"type":"French","title":"Ghost in the Shell"}],"title":"Koukaku Kidoutai","title_english":"Ghost in the Shell","title_japanese":"GHOST IN THE SHELL（攻殻機動隊）","title_synonyms":["Ghost in the Shell"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1995-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":18,"month":11,"year":1995},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 18, 1995"},"duration":"1 hr 22 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":8.27,"scored_by":322625,"rank":278,"popularity":330,"members":618976,"favorites":12680,"synopsis":"In the year 2029, Niihama City has become a technologically advanced metropolis. Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift toward globalization.\n\nThe strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the \"Puppet Master,\" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.\n\nAs Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties—including Section 6—start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case. Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was the first film to adapt Masamune Shirow's manga of the same name. It heavily condenses the original storyline, reducing the original material's comic relief and sexual content in favor of a more serious tone and changing the setting from Japan to a city modelled after Hong Kong. The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects. Ghost in the Shell is one of the world's most famous Japanese animated films, being the first to reach #1 on Billboard magazine's video best-seller list, and also served as a major inspiration for the Wachowskis in their creation of the Matrix movies. A special edition titled Ghost in the Shell: 2.0 was released in 2008, which features scenes reanimated with additional CGI to match the style of the 2004's sequel, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":268,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/268/Golden_Boy","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/62867l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Golden Boy"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ゴールデンボーイ"},{"type":"English","title":"Golden Boy"}],"title":"Golden Boy","title_english":"Golden Boy","title_japanese":"ゴールデンボーイ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":6,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1995-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1996-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":10,"year":1995},"to":{"day":28,"month":6,"year":1996}},"string":"Oct 27, 1995 to Jun 28, 1996"},"duration":"28 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":8.04,"scored_by":210497,"rank":559,"popularity":573,"members":386641,"favorites":5778,"synopsis":"Kintarou Ooe is a specialist in part-time work, riding all over the highways and byways of Japan on his trusty steed, the Mikazuki 5, and finding employment wherever he can.

It is up to Sailor Moon and the Sailor Soldiers to prevent the approaching Darkness. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":1278,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1278/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS_Gaiden__Ami-chan_no_Hatsukoi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/68371l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS Gaiden: Ami-chan no Hatsukoi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"美少女戦士セーラームーンSuperS 外伝 亜美ちゃんの初恋"},{"type":"English","title":"Sailor Moon SuperS Plus: Ami's First Love"}],"title":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS Gaiden: Ami-chan no Hatsukoi","title_english":"Sailor Moon SuperS Plus: Ami's First Love","title_japanese":"美少女戦士セーラームーンSuperS 外伝 亜美ちゃんの初恋","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1995-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":23,"month":12,"year":1995},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 23, 1995"},"duration":"15 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.31,"scored_by":12174,"rank":2590,"popularity":4237,"members":25523,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"Quiet bookworm of the Sailor Senshi Ami takes pride in her studies, but a rival naming himself \"Mercurius\" is suddenly outscoring her on the national exams.
