However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.\n\nStretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/148/Hakusensha"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":10218,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10218/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_I_-_Haou_no_Tamago","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/62179l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"22lRpLAwY04","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22lRpLAwY04","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/22lRpLAwY04?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/22lRpLAwY04/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/22lRpLAwY04/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/22lRpLAwY04/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/22lRpLAwY04/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/22lRpLAwY04/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen I - Haou no Tamago"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Berserk Movie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Berserk Saga"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Berserk: Golden Age Arc I - Egg of the Supreme Ruler"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Golden Age Arc I: The High King's Egg"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ベルセルク 黄金時代篇Ⅰ 覇王の卵"},{"type":"English","title":"Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Berserk: La Edad de Oro I.

Previously open only to high school players, the exclusive regiment trains the best players in the country for the upcoming U-17 World Cup. The high schoolers are not pleased that these middle schoolers are allowed into the camp, but the middle schoolers easily overwhelm them before they are halted by the coaches.\n\nThe rules of the camp are soon explained: the players are split into one of 16 courts based on skill, with the best players occupying Court 1. Players move up and down courts based on \"shuffle matches\" that occur before practice begins each day. In anticipation of a game, the middle schoolers are asked to pair up with one another, only to find out that they would not be playing doubles with their partners. Instead, they are pitted against each other in a tiebreaker-style game. The winner of the match would be allowed to stay to further develop their skills whereas the loser would be sent home.\n\nFor the sake of tennis, friendships and camaraderie are all put on the line. As the fierce competition between the middle and high schoolers persists, the situations they find themselves in goes deeper than just playing to remain in the camp.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"},{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":463,"type":"anime","name":"M.S.C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/463/MSC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":10638,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10638/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko__Mayonaka_no_Taiyou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36709l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko: Mayonaka no Taiyou"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko Episode 13"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Electromagnetic Wave Woman and Adolescent Man Special"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"電波女と青春男 真夜中の太陽"},{"type":"English","title":"Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl Special"}],"title":"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko: Mayonaka no Taiyou","title_english":"Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl Special","title_japanese":"電波女と青春男 真夜中の太陽","title_synonyms":["Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko Episode 13","Electromagnetic Wave Woman and Adolescent Man Special"],"type":"Special","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":2,"year":2012},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Feb 8, 2012"},"duration":"29 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.28,"scored_by":33102,"rank":2750,"popularity":2704,"members":60959,"favorites":45,"synopsis":"Episode 13 of Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko released on Blu-ray &amp;

Some changes were made such as Lupin was no longer became a thief but a detective, Jigen was no longer a smoker and it was set in the future. It was decided that the series was going to be called Arsène et Cie in France while it was called Lupin VIII internationally. Rintaro (Shigeyuki Hayashi) who worked on Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999 was the director and Shingo Araki was brought in as a character designer along with Michi Himeno. Monkey Punch had originally came up with character designs of the cast however the character designs had changed from his early designs. There was a problem during production and that was with the Maurice Leblanc estate. While the Lupin name was used in Japan and Italy at this point without issues, the Maurice Leblanc estate demanded money for the use of the Lupin name while TMS and DiC refused to pay what they were asking. This was also the same issue that had problems releasing the series outside of Japan with France adopting the Edgar de la Cambriole name, Lupin was renamed to Wolf or Cliff in the US while Spain and Italy that kept the Lupin name had to distance from Arsène Lupin affecting later dubbed episodes of Lupin the 3rd Part 2.

Together, the three eccentric aliens protect Mahiro from the various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and Earth's well-being, all the while making his life a living hell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":619,"type":"anime","name":"Cospa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/619/Cospa"},{"mal_id":621,"type":"anime","name":"SoftBank Creative","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/621/SoftBank_Creative"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1579,"type":"anime","name":"Bulls Eye","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1579/Bulls_Eye"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":12291,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/46489l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"_-kHGNw6HOw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-kHGNw6HOw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-kHGNw6HOw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-kHGNw6HOw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-kHGNw6HOw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-kHGNw6HOw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-kHGNw6HOw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-kHGNw6HOw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Acchi Kocchi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あっちこっち"},{"type":"English","title":"Place to Place"}],"title":"Acchi Kocchi","title_english":"Place to Place","title_japanese":"あっちこっち","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2012-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":4,"year":2012},"to":{"day":29,"month":6,"year":2012}},"string":"Apr 6, 2012 to Jun 29, 2012"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.48,"scored_by":146090,"rank":1842,"popularity":731,"members":315262,"favorites":2639,"synopsis":"Feelings may come and go, but true love always remains in the heart.

Starting October 1, 2013, the anime was re-broadcasted as a selection of episodes from the initial series under the title Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden Mou Iccho. It is also considered that Rock Lee Ocharake Gaiden—a separate feature shown in five installments as a bonus of Naruto Shippuuden—is essentially Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full Power Ninden's predecessor. As of March 2015, both dubbed and subtitled English versions have been made available for online streaming in the United States through Hulu and Neon Alley.","season":"spring","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":12471,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12471/Eureka_Seven_AO","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/36313l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Eureka Seven AO"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Eureka Seven Astral Ocean"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"エウレカセブンAO"}],"title":"Eureka Seven AO","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"エウレカセブンAO","title_synonyms":["Eureka Seven Astral Ocean"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2012-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":4,"year":2012},"to":{"day":20,"month":11,"year":2012}},"string":"Apr 13, 2012 to Nov 20, 2012"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.65,"scored_by":41995,"rank":5827,"popularity":2063,"members":95234,"favorites":200,"synopsis":"The story is set on Okinawa's isolated island of Iwado, which has seen a growing movement advocating a return to an autonomous government.

Sword Art Online (SAO), one of the most recent games on the console, offers a gateway into the wondrous world of Aincrad, a vivid, medieval landscape where users can do anything within the limits of imagination. With the release of this worldwide sensation, gaming has never felt more lifelike.\n\nHowever, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps thousands of players inside the game. The \"log-out\" function has been removed, with the only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\n\nWhile Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on.

Godou does not expect to get drawn into a battle between two Heretic Gods alongside Erica Blandelli, a self-proclaimed witch fighting to protect people. Fortunately, he manages to defeat the god of war in mortal combat and becomes a \"Campione\"—or \"God Slayer\"—whose duty is to fight Heretic Gods to save humanity.\n\nGodou's new status as a Campione attracts a bevy of Gods who wish to challenge him and a band of devout followers—mostly women—who are willing to aid him in his battles.

She imagines this task will be easy enough, but controlling the disasters created by the oblivious fairies in their pursuit of candy will require a lot more effort than she initially believes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita adapts content from the first 6 novels of Romeo Tanaka's light novel series of the same title.","season":"summer","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":13469,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/13469/Hyouka__Motsubeki_Mono_wa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/50363l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"vrEfVnbSppg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrEfVnbSppg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrEfVnbSppg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrEfVnbSppg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrEfVnbSppg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrEfVnbSppg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrEfVnbSppg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrEfVnbSppg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hyouka: Motsubeki Mono wa"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyouka Episode 11.5"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyouka OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyou-ka OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyouka: You can't escape OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyou-ka: You can't escape OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyoka OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"氷菓 持つべきものは"},{"type":"English","title":"Hyouka: What Should Be Had"}],"title":"Hyouka: Motsubeki Mono wa","title_english":"Hyouka: What Should Be Had","title_japanese":"氷菓 持つべきものは","title_synonyms":["Hyouka Episode 11.5","Hyouka OVA","Hyou-ka OVA","Hyouka: You can't escape OVA","Hyou-ka: You can't escape OVA","Hyoka OVA"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":7,"year":2012},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 8, 2012"},"duration":"25 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.35,"scored_by":112329,"rank":2389,"popularity":1230,"members":185866,"favorites":151,"synopsis":"It's another regular day, with Houtarou Oreki sitting at home as usual; that is until his sister Tomoe ropes him into working as a lifeguard at the local swimming pool.

As both men refuse to let go of their desires, an unusual relationship forms between a troubled woman, an unrelenting ghost, and a stubborn man in love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1765,"type":"anime","name":"Shodensha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1765/Shodensha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Doga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]},{"mal_id":12685,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12685/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_-_Nunnally_in_Wonderland","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36175l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch - Nunnally in Wonderland"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ ナナリーinワンダーランド"},{"type":"English","title":"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - Nunnally in Wonderland"}],"title":"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch - Nunnally in Wonderland","title_english":"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - Nunnally in Wonderland","title_japanese":"コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ ナナリーinワンダーランド","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":7,"year":2012},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 27, 2012"},"duration":"28 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.45,"scored_by":36224,"rank":6894,"popularity":2468,"members":71177,"favorites":38,"synopsis":"On a bright, peaceful day, siblings Nunnally and Lelouch Lamperouge take a moment to relax under a tree.

Led by the honorable yet soft-spoken Isami Kondou, the Roshigumi is composed of strong and skilled samurai but lacks any meaningful political connections to gain footing in the city plagued by crime. Having no other choice, Kondou allies with the arrogant Serizawa and his connections in exchange for their combative strength.\n\nDespite hating everything the samurai stand for, Ibuki finds himself tangled in the business of the Roshigumi. However, as he interacts with the members under Kondou's leadership, Ibuki slowly realizes that not all samurai are as cruel and dishonorable as he once thought.

This man, Rikurou Tachibana, was about to end up sold to slavers, but instead, he wound up in the eternal service of Annerose—something her other servent, Mitico didn't take too kindly to. Rikurou doesn't know what's worse, Mitico being able to chop him up into tiny pieces, only to be resurrected, or having to deal with the intense sexual frustration of living with Annerose.\n\nBoth of these problems get set aside, however, when Annerose and her servants take on a case involving a girl named Miki and her missing brother. The events of Koutetsu no Majo Annerose will lead the unlikely heroine into the workings of the Kuurou Group and their leader Lee Mayfeng, a sworn enemy from Annerose's past. Mayfeng's contempt for Annerose is deep enough to plunge into the depths of sexual depravity and she's willing to do anything to humiliate and ruin her. The danger only grows from there as yet another malevolent force is at work, one that goes well beyond threatening Amidahara and aims to bring about ruin to the entire world.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1245,"type":"anime","name":"ZIZ Entertainment (ZIZ)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1245/ZIZ_Entertainment_ZIZ"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":395,"type":"anime","name":"Oz Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/395/Oz_Inc"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":10258,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10258/Gokicha","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77941l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gokicha!!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ごきチャ!!"},{"type":"English","title":"Cockroach Girls"}],"title":"Gokicha!!","title_english":"Cockroach Girls","title_japanese":"ごきチャ!!","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":9,"year":2012},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 14, 2012"},"duration":"8 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.54,"scored_by":6949,"rank":11237,"popularity":5344,"members":14416,"favorites":22,"synopsis":"Gokicha is a small cockroach girl who has moved from Kanto to Hokkaido.

Upon quickly contacting the employer and learning that the position had yet to be filled, he applied without delay. The job was as a live-in servant at a mansion.\nHis first day of work arrived. Upon arrival at the mansion deep in the mountains he was surprised by the size of the grounds and the palatial building itself… appropriate for the richest of the rich. The mansion’s beautiful mistress and her equally beautiful daughters came out to meet him.

What the Joestars don't realize, however, is that Dario had no intention of helping them; he believed they were dead and was trying to ransack their belongings. After Dario's death 12 years later, George—hoping to repay his debt—adopts his son, Dio. \n\nWhile he publicly fawns over his new father, Dio secretly plans to steal the Joestar fortune. His first step is to create a divide between George and Jonathan. By constantly outdoing his foster brother, Dio firmly makes his place in the Joestar family. But when Dio pushes Jonathan too far, Jonathan defeats him in a brawl. \n\nYears later, the two appear to be close friends to the outside world. But trouble brews again when George falls ill, as Jonathan suspects that Dio is somehow behind the incident—and it appears he has more tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken was announced on July 5, 2012 at a press conference celebrating the 25th anniversary Hirohiko Araki's long-running series.

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"An edited version of the series received a rebroadcast starting July 10, 2014. 22 episodes of the original series were combined into eleven 46-minute long episodes with some scenes being slightly extended.

Trapped there for the time being, he must learn how to deal with his fellow residents, including bubbly animator Misaki Kamiigusa, charming playboy writer Jin Mitaka, and the ever-reclusive Ryuunosuke Akasaka. Surrounded by weirdness, Sorata frequently finds respite in his interactions with his one \"normal\" friend, aspiring voice actress Nanami Aoyama.\n\nWhen Mashiro Shiina—a new foreign exchange student—joins the dormitory, Sorata is instantly enraptured by her beauty. Underneath her otherworldly appearance, Mashiro is an autistic savant, capable of world-renowned brilliance in her art, yet unable to perform simple daily tasks. After Sorata ends up in charge of taking care of Mashiro, the two inevitably grow closer, with Sorata's initial desire to escape the dormitory becoming a forgotten goal.\n\nDespite their eccentricities, every resident is incredible in their own field, leaving Sorata to contend with his own lack of any particular skill. With brilliance all around him, he thus strives to become an equal to their talent.

Alternatively titled \"Ein’s Summer Vacation,\" the special is paired with the song \"Doggy Dog,\" as performed in English by Seatbelts, responsible for much of the musical score that appears throughout the main anime series. The same track can be found on their album Cowboy Bebop Vitaminless. In 2013, distributor Anime Limited acquired a home video license for the United Kingdom; Part 1 of the Blu-ray collection was released on July 29, 2013. Appearing on the Part 1 disc, this would be the first time Western audiences could obtain a copy of the bonus short for themselves.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":15097,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15097/Tropical_Kiss","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1581/103852l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tropical Kiss"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"トロピカルKISS"}],"title":"Tropical Kiss","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"トロピカルKISS","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Visual novel","episodes":3,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":10,"year":2012},"to":{"day":28,"month":3,"year":2014}},"string":"Oct 26, 2012 to Mar 28, 2014"},"duration":"29 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":7.08,"scored_by":10823,"rank":null,"popularity":4172,"members":26388,"favorites":193,"synopsis":"Kaito left his hometown with a dream to be a big man.
