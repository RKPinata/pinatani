The Earth is in a time of prosperity. The president of the Terran League (the \"Galaxy Alliance\" in Voltron) launches a mission to explore beyond the galaxy. After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\n\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as \"Rugger,\" which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union. The U.S. version would rename the \"Galbeston Empire\" to \"Drule Empire,\" along with editing a fair amount of violence and sexual content to keep the show safe for general audience broadcast.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1982,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2573,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2573/Minami_no_Niji_no_Lucy","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/102083l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Minami no Niji no Lucy"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sekai Meisaku Gekijou"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"南の虹のルーシー"},{"type":"English","title":"Lucy-May of the Southern Rainbow"}],"title":"Minami no Niji no Lucy","title_english":"Lucy-May of the Southern Rainbow","title_japanese":"南の虹のルーシー","title_synonyms":["Sekai Meisaku Gekijou"],"type":"TV","source":"Novel","episodes":50,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1982-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":1,"year":1982},"to":{"day":26,"month":12,"year":1982}},"string":"Jan 10, 1982 to Dec 26, 1982"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.12,"scored_by":792,"rank":3579,"popularity":10036,"members":2645,"favorites":11,"synopsis":"Lucy's family moves from England to Australia planning to run a big farm.

Akira Miyazaki single-handedly wrote five of the classic WMT series, including Perrine and Rascal, and participated in two others. The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film. \n\nThe story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original. The character designs are slightly more western-looking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":339,"type":"anime","name":"Rankin/Bass","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/339/Rankin_Bass"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8011,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8011/Time_Bokan_Series__Gyakuten_Ippatsuman","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19572l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Time Bokan Series: Gyakuten Ippatsuman"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Go for it"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ippatsuman!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Time Machine Series Ippatsuman the Antihero"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"逆転!イッパツマン"}],"title":"Time Bokan Series: Gyakuten Ippatsuman","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"逆転!イッパツマン","title_synonyms":["Go for it","Ippatsuman!","Time Machine Series Ippatsuman the Antihero"],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":58,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1983-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":2,"year":1982},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":1983}},"string":"Feb 13, 1982 to Mar 26, 1983"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.84,"scored_by":263,"rank":10001,"popularity":12354,"members":1203,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Gyakuten!

Okon enters her home and Itako tells the fox that he is welcome to take anything that he wants, for she has no use for anything anymore. Okon is delighted and in order to return the favour (the act of ongaeshi), Okon performs a magic jyōruri (a ballad with shamisen accompaniment) that heals Itako so that she is fit enough to walk again. Everyone is surprised by Itako's sudden recovery. She then hears of a hunter who has been badly injured and is near death. Itako hides Okon in the back of her shirt and has the fox sing the song while she plays shamisen in order to heal the man. This act of kindness is repeated for others until Itako's good fortune leads some to be suspicious of her.\n \n(Source: Nishikata Film Review)","background":"Winner of the 1982 Oofuji Noburou Award at the Mainichi Film Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":10285,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10285/Manga_Nippon_Mukashibanashi_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28284l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi (Movie)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi (1982)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Japanese Folklore Tales Movie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi Movie"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"まんが日本昔ばなし"}],"title":"Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi (Movie)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"まんが日本昔ばなし","title_synonyms":["Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi (1982)","Japanese Folklore Tales Movie","Manga Nippon Mukashibanashi Movie"],"type":"Movie","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":3,"year":1982},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 13, 1982"},"duration":"12 min","rating":"G -

The mysterious medallion that Esteban wears since ever has a trace somewhere in the New World, probably coming from the Mysterious Cities of Gold. Esteban leaves Spain to find his parents and find out who he is. On the way he meets Zia, an Inca girl who was kidnapped from her people years back and has exactly the same medallion as him. Later on, they are joined by Tao, a young Galapagos robinson, the last descendant of the Empire of Heva, an Empire said to have built the Cities of Gold.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world's entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack ('Bishounen-Killer') Bancoran. Bancoran's nickname doesn't mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran's eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour's flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran's palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, while Jack's 'apartment' bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst's spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1982,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":3136,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3136/Ochamegami_Monogatari__Korokoro_Pollon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/60529l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Pollon"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Poron"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ochamegami Monogatari Kolokolo Polon"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Story of Little Goddess Roly-Poly Pollon"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Little Pollen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"おちゃめ神物語コロコロポロン"},{"type":"English","title":"Little Pollon"}],"title":"Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Pollon","title_english":"Little Pollon","title_japanese":"おちゃめ神物語コロコロポロン","title_synonyms":["Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Poron","Ochamegami Monogatari Kolokolo Polon","The Story of Little Goddess Roly-Poly Pollon","Little Pollen"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":46,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1983-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":5,"year":1982},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":1983}},"string":"May 8, 1982 to Mar 26, 1983"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.15,"scored_by":1605,"rank":3425,"popularity":9393,"members":3319,"favorites":14,"synopsis":"Anime about the funny lives of the Greek gods up on Mount Olympus.

Unlike the original International Rescue, which was small-scale and family-oriented, the IRO is a vast organisation comprising numerous branches and overseen by the Federation, the 2086 equivalent of the United Nations. No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher. There is a heavy intimation in the series that Star Crusher is not human and may be some kind of alien entity.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1982,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5933,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5933/Shiroi_Kiba_White_Fang_Monogatari","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81828l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shiroi Kiba White Fang Monogatari"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"White Fang Story"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"白い牙ホワイトファング物語"}],"title":"Shiroi Kiba White Fang Monogatari","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"白い牙ホワイトファング物語","title_synonyms":["White Fang Story"],"type":"Special","source":"Novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":5,"year":1982},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 5, 1982"},"duration":"1 hr 13 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.35,"scored_by":353,"rank":7442,"popularity":12425,"members":1175,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"White Fang is born on the planes of Alaska to a wolf father and a half-wolf, half-dog mother.

The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force—the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine.

Fearing a potential threat from space, the world pushes aside their nationalism, conflicting interests, and cultural differences, unifying under the banner of the United Nations. The newly formed UN forces decide to repurpose the alien spacecraft, naming it SDF-1 Macross. Unfortunately, on the day of its maiden voyage, a fleet of spaceships belonging to a race of aliens known as the Zentradi descend upon Earth, and the SDF-1 Macross, acting of its own accord, shoots down the incoming squadron, sparking an intergalactic war.\n\nIn an attempt to escape, the Macross tries to launch itself into the Moon's orbit, but the ship—as well as the city it was in—is teleported to the far reaches of space. Caught up in this mess are Hikaru Ichijou, a free-spirited acrobatic pilot, and Minmay Lynn, an aspiring singer. These two, alongside Macross' crew, experience an epic journey rife with grief and drama, coming face-to-face with the cruelties of war along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1982,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"14:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 14:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Artland","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":199,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Nue","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/199/Studio_Nue"},{"mal_id":351,"type":"anime","name":"Big West","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/351/Big_West"},{"mal_id":1990,"type":"anime","name":"Anime Friend","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1990/Anime_Friend"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"},{"mal_id":2278,"type":"anime","name":"Harmony Gold","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2451,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2451/Space_Cobra","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/41437l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"G6-BiwiFgMk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-BiwiFgMk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6-BiwiFgMk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6-BiwiFgMk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6-BiwiFgMk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6-BiwiFgMk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6-BiwiFgMk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6-BiwiFgMk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Space Cobra"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スペースコブラ"},{"type":"English","title":"Space Adventure Cobra"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Super Agente Cobra"},{"type":"French","title":"Space Adventure Cobra"}],"title":"Space Cobra","title_english":"Space Adventure Cobra","title_japanese":"スペースコブラ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":31,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1982-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1983-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":10,"year":1982},"to":{"day":19,"month":5,"year":1983}},"string":"Oct 7, 1982 to May 19, 1983"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.67,"scored_by":7021,"rank":1250,"popularity":4470,"members":22453,"favorites":271,"synopsis":"Lonely salaryman Johnson laments his meager life, longing for a world of travel and excitement.
