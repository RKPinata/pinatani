A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1507,"type":"anime","name":"Sumitomo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1507/Sumitomo"},{"mal_id":1581,"type":"anime","name":"RAY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1581/RAY"},{"mal_id":2111,"type":"anime","name":"Pia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2111/Pia"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":38790,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38790/Itai_no_wa_Iya_nanode_Bougyoryoku_ni_Kyokufuri_Shitai_to_Omoimasu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"AODnWIirajU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AODnWIirajU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AODnWIirajU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AODnWIirajU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AODnWIirajU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AODnWIirajU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AODnWIirajU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AODnWIirajU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Itai no wa Iya nanode Bougyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu."},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I hate being in pain"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"so I think I'll make a full defense build."},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I Hate Getting Hurt"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"So I Put All My Skill Points Into Defense"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"痛いのは嫌なので防御力に極振りしたいと思います。"},{"type":"English","title":"BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense."},{"type":"German","title":"Bofuri: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense"}],"title":"Itai no wa Iya nanode Bougyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu.","title_english":"BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense.","title_japanese":"痛いのは嫌なので防御力に極振りしたいと思います。","title_synonyms":["I hate being in pain","so I think I'll make a full defense build.","I Hate Getting Hurt","So I Put All My Skill Points Into Defense"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2020},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2020}},"string":"Jan 8, 2020 to Mar 25, 2020"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.53,"scored_by":288389,"rank":1684,"popularity":413,"members":515306,"favorites":3668,"synopsis":"After an enthusiastic invitation from her friend, Kaede Honjou reluctantly agrees to try New World Online: a very popular VRMMO played by thousands of people across Japan.

With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis does not end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit.

Through the use of so-called \"cognition particles\" left behind at a crime scene by the perpetrator, detectives from the specialized police squad Kura can manifest a criminal's unconscious mind as a bizarre stream of thoughts in a virtual world. Their task is to explore this psychological plane, called an \"id well,\" to reveal the identity of the culprit.\n\nNot just anyone can enter the id wells; the prerequisite is that you must have killed someone yourself. Such is the case for former detective Akihito Narihisago, who is known as \"Sakaido\" inside the id wells. Once a respected member of the police, tragedy struck, and he soon found himself on the other side of the law.\n\nNevertheless, Narihisago continues to assist Kura in confinement. While his prodigious detective skills still prove useful toward investigations, Narihisago discovers that not everything is as it seems, as behind the seemingly standalone series of murder cases lurks a much more sinister truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1614,"type":"anime","name":"NTT Plala","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1614/NTT_Plala"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1983,"type":"anime","name":"Anima&Co.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1983/Anima_Co"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":951,"type":"anime","name":"NAZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/951/NAZ"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":38992,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38992/Rikei_ga_Koi_ni_Ochita_no_de_Shoumei_shitemita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Wb2xA_Yl0ME","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb2xA_Yl0ME","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wb2xA_Yl0ME?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wb2xA_Yl0ME/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wb2xA_Yl0ME/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wb2xA_Yl0ME/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wb2xA_Yl0ME/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wb2xA_Yl0ME/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita."},{"type":"Synonym","title":"RikeKoi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"理系が恋に落ちたので証明してみた。"},{"type":"English","title":"Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It"},{"type":"German","title":"Science Fell In Love, So I Tried To Prove it"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It"},{"type":"French","title":"Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it"}],"title":"Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita.","title_english":"Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It","title_japanese":"理系が恋に落ちたので証明してみた。","title_synonyms":["RikeKoi"],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":1,"year":2020},"to":{"day":28,"month":3,"year":2020}},"string":"Jan 11, 2020 to Mar 28, 2020"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.36,"scored_by":142330,"rank":2343,"popularity":671,"members":338166,"favorites":1138,"synopsis":"It is widely believed that science can provide rational explanations for the countless phenomena of our universe.

Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":874,"type":"anime","name":"Flex Comix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/874/Flex_Comix"},{"mal_id":1221,"type":"anime","name":"Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1221/Hokkaido_Cultural_Broadcasting"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1677,"type":"anime","name":"Kanetsu Investment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment"},{"mal_id":1985,"type":"anime","name":"Toyo Recording","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1985/Toyo_Recording"},{"mal_id":2093,"type":"anime","name":"ibis Capital Partners","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2093/ibis_Capital_Partners"},{"mal_id":2096,"type":"anime","name":"Y&N Brothers","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2096/Y_N_Brothers"},{"mal_id":2108,"type":"anime","name":"SUPA LOVE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2108/SUPA_LOVE"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39792,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39792/Eizouken_ni_wa_Te_wo_Dasu_na","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1680/110451l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"acYbdQImkp4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acYbdQImkp4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/acYbdQImkp4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/acYbdQImkp4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/acYbdQImkp4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/acYbdQImkp4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/acYbdQImkp4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/acYbdQImkp4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hands off the Motion Pictures Club!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"映像研には手を出すな!"},{"type":"English","title":"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!"},{"type":"German","title":"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!"},{"type":"French","title":"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!"}],"title":"Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!","title_english":"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!","title_japanese":"映像研には手を出すな!","title_synonyms":["Hands off the Motion Pictures Club!"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":1,"year":2020},"to":{"day":23,"month":3,"year":2020}},"string":"Jan 6, 2020 to Mar 23, 2020"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.13,"scored_by":134113,"rank":441,"popularity":696,"members":326410,"favorites":4011,"synopsis":"Midori Asakusa sees the world a bit differently.

The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa's childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori's calculated approach to life. \n\nAfter a chance encounter where the two \"save\" the young model Tsubame Misuzaki from her overprotective bodyguard, a connection instantly sparks between Asakusa and Misuzaki, as both share an intense passion for art and animation. Whereas Asakusa is interested in backgrounds and settings, Misuzaki loves drawing the human form. Sensing a money-making opportunity, Kanamori suggests that they start an animation club, which they disguise as a motion picture club since the school already has an anime club. Thus begins the trio's journey of producing animation that will awe the world. \n\nFrom the brilliant mind of Masaaki Yuasa, Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! is a love letter to animation, wildly creative in its approach, and a testament to the potential of the medium.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the Grand Prize at the 24th Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:10","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":415,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Bros.

After getting to know each other, the two decide to create a cooking club, and after a few bad-blooded misunderstandings, Ranka soon joins the club as well.\n\nThus begins the howl-some and howl-arious story of two normal humans; an adorable wolf; a cheerful koala; a sluggish, blonde sloth; and a feline with cattitude in their newfound club—in a story that teaches that friendship can be forged by creatures of different kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":140,"type":"anime","name":"Animax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/140/Animax"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"},{"mal_id":1908,"type":"anime","name":"Legs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1908/Legs"},{"mal_id":1933,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1933/Happinet"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":418,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Gokumi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":38909,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38909/Infinite_Dendrogram","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/114772l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ESwp36zs30g","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESwp36zs30g","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESwp36zs30g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ESwp36zs30g/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ESwp36zs30g/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ESwp36zs30g/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ESwp36zs30g/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ESwp36zs30g/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Infinite Dendrogram"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"-インフィニット・デンドログラム-"},{"type":"English","title":"Infinite Dendrogram"}],"title":"Infinite Dendrogram","title_english":"Infinite Dendrogram","title_japanese":"-インフィニット・デンドログラム-","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":1,"year":2020},"to":{"day":16,"month":4,"year":2020}},"string":"Jan 9, 2020 to Apr 16, 2020"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.19,"scored_by":78005,"rank":8303,"popularity":1328,"members":172368,"favorites":272,"synopsis":"In the year 2043, &lt;Infinite Dendrogram&gt;, the world's first successful full-dive VRMMO was released.

Luckily, her opportunity comes in the form of SIVA, an original feature film scheduled to release in 10 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Aoi's friends are also facing problems with their own professions: animation supervisor Ema Yasuhara is struggling to keep up with her tight schedule; reporter and voice actress Shizuka Sakaki is discontent with the lack of anime roles; screenwriter Midori Imai has been unable to find inspiration since her previous failure; and 3D artist Misa Toudou is concerned that her excessive passion hinders her career.\n\nWhile the anime industry is one full of setbacks and uncertainties, the five girls are all hellbent on persevering through the arduous path ahead—which just might bring them a step closer to accomplishing their shared dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shirobako Movie premiered in North American theaters on August 10, 2021.

Although dragons present a great danger, every part of them is extremely valuable, and brave dragon hunters, called \"drakers,\" risk their lives aboard special dragon-hunting airships to pursue them.\n\nHowever, despite the thrill and excitement of hunting, the life of a draker is not easy. Ostracized by society, the drakers have no place to call home. Life in the air is not any easier either: maintaining an airship is dull and expensive—and dragons are even harder to catch, as each one is unique. \n\nOne of the last remaining such airships is the Quin Zaza. Its courageous crew includes Takita, an eager newcomer trying to earn her place on the ship; Mika, a reckless but highly skilled hunter; and Jirou, an earnest young man chasing both the dragons and his past. United by the same goal, these hunters face arduous aerial battles that involve daring feats of skill, strategy, and more than their fair share of danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":230,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"},{"mal_id":677,"type":"anime","name":"Nexon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/677/Nexon"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1488,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Media Partners","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1488/Hakuhodo_DY_Media_Partners"},{"mal_id":1556,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji Creative","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1556/Fuji_Creative"},{"mal_id":1992,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Spirits","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1992/Bandai_Spirits"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1023,"type":"anime","name":"Polygon Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1023/Polygon_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":37890,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37890/Oshi_ga_Budoukan_Ittekuretara_Shinu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/104708l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"svBwR-BcwWw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svBwR-BcwWw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/svBwR-BcwWw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/svBwR-BcwWw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/svBwR-BcwWw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/svBwR-BcwWw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/svBwR-BcwWw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/svBwR-BcwWw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Oshi ga Budoukan Ittekuretara Shinu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"OshiBudou"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"推しが武道館いってくれたら死ぬ"},{"type":"English","title":"If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die"}],"title":"Oshi ga Budoukan Ittekuretara Shinu","title_english":"If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die","title_japanese":"推しが武道館いってくれたら死ぬ","title_synonyms":["OshiBudou"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":1,"year":2020},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":2020}},"string":"Jan 10, 2020 to Mar 27, 2020"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.43,"scored_by":18383,"rank":2036,"popularity":3219,"members":43886,"favorites":329,"synopsis":"After receiving a flyer from Maina Ichii—a member of the idol group ChamJam—and seeing her perform at a local concert, Eripiyo falls in love with Maina and decides to devote her life to supporting the shy and reserved rising star.

Previously, she was a Kumari—a prepubescent girl worshipped as the vessel of a goddess. But she has since been forsaken as a Kumari, and cast out from society. Falling in love, they marry and move to Korea, but their blissful love is short-lived; Sita dies only a year later.\n\nLosing the woman dearest to him, Sangmin desperately begs the gods to bring Sita back. His prayers are answered but in exchange for a sacrifice, and he awakens in the streets of Nepal. However, something is amiss—his body has suddenly aged, and standing in front of him is a young Sita, with no memory of him.\n\nThrough two lovers bound together by a destiny running deeper than it first appears, For the Sake of Sita is the story of Sita growing up as a Kumari, and Sangmin's tribulations in trying to avert her terrible fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":41421,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41421/Kyouryuu_Shoujo_Gauko_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1284/106412l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kyouryuu Shoujo Gauko 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"恐竜少女ガウ子シーズン2"},{"type":"English","title":"Dino Girl Gauko Season 2"}],"title":"Kyouryuu Shoujo Gauko 2nd Season","title_english":"Dino Girl Gauko Season 2","title_japanese":"恐竜少女ガウ子シーズン2","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Original","episodes":19,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":3,"year":2020},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 20, 2020"},"duration":"9 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.28,"scored_by":554,"rank":7848,"popularity":12827,"members":1038,"favorites":3,"synopsis":"The comedy series is set in Japan and follows Naoko Watanabe, a typical tween girl aside from the fact that she possesses strange and sometimes troubling powers.

Deciding to save her, he transforms and carries her to safety, but accidentally drops his phone.\n\nThe next day, the girl he saved—Claire Aoki—finds him and confronts him about his monster identity. She even goes so far as to push him off the school roof to prove her theory after Shuuichi denies her allegations.

Arte, a delightful young lady from an aristocratic family, dreams of being an artist and contributing to the renewal of civilization. However, with her father's death, she ends up losing the only person who believed in her passion for art. Now she is expected to marry a nobleman and live as a refined housewife without disgracing her family name. Reluctant to accept her fate, the headstrong Arte steps into the streets in search of a master artisan to take her on as an apprentice.\n\nIn her quest for a mentor, Arte has to face harsh reality when she is completely shunned for being a female artist.

Despite there being no apparent end to their grand mission, they remain committed to the cause in hope of resolving the mystery behind their collective resurrection as well as questions that have haunted their former lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:23","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:23 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39049,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39049/Jashin-chan_Dropkick","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/111421l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"kEQ3tEGKUa0","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQ3tEGKUa0","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEQ3tEGKUa0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEQ3tEGKUa0/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEQ3tEGKUa0/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEQ3tEGKUa0/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEQ3tEGKUa0/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEQ3tEGKUa0/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Jashin-chan Dropkick'"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"False God My Dropkick 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dropkick on My Devil!! 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"邪神ちゃんドロップキック'（ダッシュ）"},{"type":"English","title":"Dropkick on My Devil!!

They used to play catch together whenever possible, and in doing so, Yomi discovered her talent for throwing the ball in a way that seemed like magic. The girls promised to keep playing baseball even when they are older and were separated soon after. In the years that followed, Tamaki went on to become a skilled catcher, but Yomi did not get very far despite her throwing prowess.\n\nDeciding to quit her passion, Yomi starts her first year at Shin Koshigaya High School. Try as she might to avoid anything related to baseball, she meets the twins Yoshino and Ibuki Kawaguchi, both of whom are enthusiasts of the sport. Moreover, she stumbles upon Tamaki, and just like old times, they decide to play catch—reigniting Yomi’s desire to pitch.\n\nReunited, Yomi and Tamaki set out to fulfill their childhood promise. Alongside Yoshino and Ibuki, they strive to revive their school’s baseball team which has been on hiatus. More members join until their group is complete, and now the new goal of Shin Koshigaya's girls' baseball team is nothing less than winning the national championships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":2290,"type":"anime","name":"A3","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2290/A3"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1209,"type":"anime","name":"Studio A-CAT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1209/Studio_A-CAT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":40358,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40358/Gal_to_Kyouryuu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1603/111352l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"6PbCJNNffFg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PbCJNNffFg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PbCJNNffFg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6PbCJNNffFg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6PbCJNNffFg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6PbCJNNffFg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6PbCJNNffFg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6PbCJNNffFg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gal to Kyouryuu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Gal and Dinosaur"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"My Roomie Is a Dino"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Gyaru to Kyouryuu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ギャルと恐竜"},{"type":"English","title":"Gal & Dino"}],"title":"Gal to Kyouryuu","title_english":"Gal & Dino","title_japanese":"ギャルと恐竜","title_synonyms":["Gal and Dinosaur","My Roomie Is a Dino","Gyaru to Kyouryuu"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2020},"to":{"day":20,"month":12,"year":2020}},"string":"Apr 5, 2020 to Dec 20, 2020"},"duration":"11 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.45,"scored_by":9671,"rank":6899,"popularity":3800,"members":31949,"favorites":85,"synopsis":"Wasted from the night before, Kaede wakes up the next morning to find herself at home with a dinosaur she had brought along with her.

Despite coming to Earth to meet humans, Neil discovers that not a single one of his new roommates is actually human. Along with Ira, there's Lynn Angel, the stern angel landlord; Lynn's little sister, Lily, who falls from Heaven; Abu, a mummy who never speaks; and Vladimir Eliot Kirilenko, a werewolf tasked with monitoring Neil.\n\nWhat most of them don't realize—not even Neil himself—is that Neil possesses the powers of the Demon King.

Witnessing the devastation left behind by the calamities known as Sin Archbishops, Subaru sinks into the depths of despair as his ability to redo proves futile.\n\nAs the group makes their way to the Sanctuary in search of answers, Subaru has an unexpected encounter with the Witch of Greed—Echidna.

At any rate, whenever Uzaki wants to hang out with her upperclassman, fun and adorable wackiness is sure to follow!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":392,"type":"anime","name":"Enterbrain","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/392/Enterbrain"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1731,"type":"anime","name":"INCS toenter","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1731/INCS_toenter"},{"mal_id":1903,"type":"anime","name":"IMAGICA Lab.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1903/IMAGICA_Lab"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1974,"type":"anime","name":"ENGI","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1974/ENGI"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33050,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33050/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_-_III_Spring_Song","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"zfjbLLxdZOU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfjbLLxdZOU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfjbLLxdZOU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - III.

However, accomplishing such a feat with so many alluring women on his trail is easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2052,"type":"anime","name":"Wolfsbane","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2052/Wolfsbane"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":49,"type":"anime","name":"Erotica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/49/Erotica"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":42603,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42603/Boku_no_Hero_Academia__Ikinokore_Kesshi_no_Survival_Kunren","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1345/108741l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Boku no Hero Academia: Ikinokore!

Largely uninhabited and covered by dense forests, these monster-infested regions are abundant in a mysterious ore called the Nova Stone. The coveted stone overflows with energy, and those successful in their hunt are bound to acquire obscene amounts of wealth. Yet the frontier remains a dreadful place. The only ones capable of staving off imminent devastation to human settlements are the hunters. Since their weapons, powered by Nova Stone, are capable of vanquishing the beasts, these brave souls are tasked with the protection of otherwise defenseless towns.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Erika Amber was taken in by a huntress and raised as her successor. However, she is no ordinary human; her elven lineage has remained a mystery for Erika her entire life. Hoping to discover more about her ancestors, she ventures deep into the unexplored forests, leaving civilization behind. But before departing, she decides to visit Azul—the son of a recently deceased hunter—one last time. In a heart-to-heart talk, the boy reveals he admires the huntress and is deeply in love with her. As luck would have it, the feeling is mutual, and the memory of the passionate lovemaking that follows is likely to keep Erika warm during the long, chilly nights throughout her journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":541,"type":"anime","name":"Seven","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/541/Seven"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":48861,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48861/Chuukou_Ikkan_Kimetsu_Gakuen_Monogatari__Kimetsu_no_Utage_Tokubetsu-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/125846l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Chuukou Ikkan!!

However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the King of Curses.\n\nYuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the Anime of the Year (TV Series) at the 2022 Tokyo Anime Award Festival (TAAF).","season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"},{"mal_id":2260,"type":"anime","name":"Sumzap","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2260/Sumzap"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":40028,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40028/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/110531l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"SlNpRThS9t8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlNpRThS9t8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlNpRThS9t8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SlNpRThS9t8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SlNpRThS9t8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SlNpRThS9t8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SlNpRThS9t8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SlNpRThS9t8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Attack on Titan Season 4"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"進撃の巨人 The Final Season"},{"type":"English","title":"Attack on Titan: Final Season"},{"type":"German","title":"Attack on Titan Final Season"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Ataque a los Titanes Temporada Final"},{"type":"French","title":"L'Attaque des Titans Saison Finale"}],"title":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season","title_english":"Attack on Titan: Final Season","title_japanese":"進撃の巨人 The Final Season","title_synonyms":["Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4","Attack on Titan Season 4"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":16,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":12,"year":2020},"to":{"day":29,"month":3,"year":2021}},"string":"Dec 7, 2020 to Mar 29, 2021"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.79,"scored_by":1260678,"rank":38,"popularity":39,"members":1906497,"favorites":51714,"synopsis":"Gabi Braun and Falco Grice have been training their entire lives to inherit one of the seven Titans under Marley's control and aid their nation in eradicating the Eldians on Paradis.

Whether it be the fur of fluffy demonic teddy bears or the silky, blanket-like bodies of ghost shrouds, everything is but a means to ensure a peaceful slumber. With so many potential materials to craft items that can help her sleep at her disposal, nothing will stop the sleepy princess—not even death.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"02:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 02:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Doga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":41312,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41312/Kami-tachi_ni_Hirowareta_Otoko","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1654/108801l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ZhqrSlogE0w","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhqrSlogE0w","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhqrSlogE0w?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZhqrSlogE0w/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZhqrSlogE0w/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZhqrSlogE0w/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZhqrSlogE0w/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZhqrSlogE0w/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The man picked up by the gods"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kamihiro"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kamitachi ni Hirowareta Otoko"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"神達に拾われた男"},{"type":"English","title":"By the Grace of the Gods"},{"type":"German","title":"By the Grace of the Gods"},{"type":"French","title":"By the Grace of the Gods"}],"title":"Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko","title_english":"By the Grace of the Gods","title_japanese":"神達に拾われた男","title_synonyms":["The man picked up by the gods","Kamihiro","Kamitachi ni Hirowareta Otoko"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":10,"year":2020},"to":{"day":20,"month":12,"year":2020}},"string":"Oct 4, 2020 to Dec 20, 2020"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.98,"scored_by":107152,"rank":4214,"popularity":1140,"members":203338,"favorites":1017,"synopsis":"Deep in the forest, far from any human contact, there lives a child named Ryouma Takebayashi.

The call to arms soon arrives and the scattered witches of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing must be gathered once again for a final push against the enemy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1334,"type":"anime","name":"Docomo Anime Store","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1576,"type":"anime","name":"DeNA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1576/DeNA"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":287,"type":"anime","name":"David Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/287/David_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":42392,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42392/Grisaia__Phantom_Trigger_The_Animation_-_Stargazer","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1730/108516l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Sn7SVYn6ut8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn7SVYn6ut8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sn7SVYn6ut8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sn7SVYn6ut8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sn7SVYn6ut8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sn7SVYn6ut8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sn7SVYn6ut8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sn7SVYn6ut8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Grisaia: Phantom Trigger The Animation - Stargazer"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"グリザイア：ファントムトリガー THE ANIMATION スターゲイザー"}],"title":"Grisaia: Phantom Trigger The Animation - Stargazer","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"グリザイア：ファントムトリガー THE ANIMATION スターゲイザー","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Visual novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":11,"year":2020},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 27, 2020"},"duration":"1 hr","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.9,"scored_by":5660,"rank":4550,"popularity":4210,"members":25942,"favorites":18,"synopsis":"While Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip.

Known to be the first to climb the Stairway to Heaven, he was expected to become the leader of gods.\n\nHowever, Jiang Ziya's final task to execute the Nine-Tailed soon took a turn for the worse when the demon created an illusion and showed Jiang Ziya an innocent girl trapped inside her. Growing doubtful, he freed the fox spirit to save the girl. As a punishment for his transgression, Jiang Ziya was banished to the North Sea, with his divine power sealed, until he would no longer be plagued by the Nine-Tailed's mirage.\n\nTen years later, Jiang Ziya dwells in the North Sea alongside his friend Shen Gongbao and his pet Si Bu Xiang. At a bar, Jiang Ziya meets Xiao Jiu—who resembles the girl from the illusion. When he asks her about the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon's bracelet on her ankle, she tells him that the accessory reveals to her a place where black flowers bloom. Conflicted over what to believe, Jiang Ziya accompanies Xiao Jiu to Mount Youdu. Thus, the two begin a formidable journey that might uncover not only the truth Jiang Ziya has been searching for, but also shocking facts about the great war of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Jiang Ziya is loosely based on the Ming-dynasty Chinese novel Investiture of the Gods by Xu Zhonglin. The animated feature was initially scheduled to premiere on January 25, 2020, but was delayed to October 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Infected animals mutate into frightening and massively attacking monsters. When humans face destruction, they build walls and build base cities as the last bastion of man. The trials experienced by mankind during this period of time are called the \"Period of Nirvana.\" In extreme living environments, human power is also gradually advancing and evolving, and martial arts are emerging, and human power is qualitatively increasing compared to before. And the best of them is called the Warriors. Luo Feng, 18, also aspires to be one of them. Currently, she will take the college entrance exam and face a choice at a crossroads in her life, but suddenly a monster attack affects the trajectory of her life. Under the threat of powerful monsters, the inhabitants of the city are in danger, but the military is powerless. Only one soldier stood up and maintained the security of the base city. Luo Feng is infected by a warrior force, and secretly he decides to become a fighter to protect his loved ones. This is the beginning of everything, the starting point of Luo Feng's journey as a martial artist, and also the beginning of his legendary life. Luo Feng aspires to be a martial artist, but the road ahead is not smooth. The first thing he has to deal with is the influence of the outside environment that is not visible to him.

In the shorts' story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their \"god phones\" to be able to return to heaven. They aim to perform good deeds on particularly auspicious days to maximize point accumulation. Despite their best efforts at accumulating virtue, sometimes the Seven Gods of Fortune end up bringing misfortune to humans. When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"07:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 07:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":45042,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/45042/Lengxue_Kuang_Yan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1639/113687l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Lengxue Kuang Yan"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"L.O.R.D: Legend of Ravaging Dynasties 2 -

Each of our thoughtless taps or pretty selfies can easily drive Smart World into chaos. But the same goes the other way – when our smartphone malfunctions our days can easily be ruined. \n\nIn this oddly balanced back and forth – where what seems small in one world can become huge in the other – are our protagonists Jackie and Robin. These two don’t quite mesh. They are a team with no teamwork. They just don’t seem reliable enough for us to entrust our smart devices. But they do remind us that their, and our \"Smart Life\" can easily become comedy.\n\n(Source: WelCon)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2783,"type":"anime","name":"ANYZAC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2783/ANYZAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[]}]}}
