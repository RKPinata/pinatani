There he meets Rui, a girl whose lack of excitement rivals that of himself. After bonding over their mutual awkwardness, Rui takes Natsuo to her house and asks him to have sex with her, hoping that the experience will stop her friends from treating her like a clueless child.

With devices that can convert any liquid into drinkable water, deodorize the most foul smells, or even generate dark matter to be used as a means of concealment, it seems like nothing is beyond Ueno's capabilities. However, she doesn't invent these devices for the advancement of mankind. Rather, the one force that motivates her is love, the only phenomenon she can't quite figure out.\n\nUeno is head over heels for Tanaka, her nonchalant fellow club member. Yet, because she is too nervous to confess her love and he is too oblivious to notice her affection, her love life is completely stagnant. In Ueno's mind, if she could just expose him to perverted situations, then surely he'd get flustered and fall for her, right? Assisted by her stone-faced classmate and dedicated wingwoman Yamashita, Ueno employs her many inventions on Tanaka in a lewd manner in hopes that he may one day understand how she feels.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1829,"type":"anime","name":"Lesprit","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1829/Lesprit"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":36792,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36792/Eromanga-sensei_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/96343l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"GHeQB_dBeNs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeQB_dBeNs","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHeQB_dBeNs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHeQB_dBeNs/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHeQB_dBeNs/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHeQB_dBeNs/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHeQB_dBeNs/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHeQB_dBeNs/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Eromanga-sensei OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ero Manga Sensei: Imouto to Akazu no Ma OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"エロマンガ先生 OVA"},{"type":"English","title":"Eromanga Sensei OVA"}],"title":"Eromanga-sensei OVA","title_english":"Eromanga Sensei OVA","title_japanese":"エロマンガ先生 OVA","title_synonyms":["Ero Manga Sensei: Imouto to Akazu no Ma OVA"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":1,"year":2019},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jan 16, 2019"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.8,"scored_by":58785,"rank":5041,"popularity":1825,"members":113859,"favorites":185,"synopsis":"Yamada Elf's Love Song\n\nAs a novelist with works getting adapted into anime, Elf Yamada holds an event to celebrate her success and to thank everyone who had supported her.

Calamity befalls the human race when malevolent creatures known as \"daemons\" scourge the land and obliterate armies with seemingly unstoppable brute force. In these dire times, nobles of House Caelum rise to prominence. Owing to their god-given healing powers, which allow them to purge the plague spread by the monsters, they earn the people's trust and allegiance.\n\nWith no leader to rule the first human kingdom and guide the masses, the gods fervently seek to fill this vacancy—a man of the Caelum bloodline seems to be a desirable choice. The ambitious and charismatic pragmatist, Somnus Lucis Caelum, is pit against his humble and altruistic brother, Ardyn Lucis Caelum, in competition for the throne. As tensions rise between the rivals and anticipations surge, the fate of the world rests upon one of the two's decisive victory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Satelight","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39380,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39380/Wei_Kanjian_Erduo_La_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1309/99419l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Wei, Kanjian Erduo La! 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hora"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mimi ga Mieteru yo! 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Look"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I Can See Your Ears! 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"喂，看见耳朵啦 第二季"}],"title":"Wei, Kanjian Erduo La! 2","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"喂，看见耳朵啦 第二季","title_synonyms":["Hora","Mimi ga Mieteru yo! 2","Look","I Can See Your Ears! 2"],"type":"ONA","source":"Web manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":2,"year":2019},"to":{"day":13,"month":4,"year":2019}},"string":"Feb 2, 2019 to Apr 13, 2019"},"duration":"3 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

From the parody space adventure \"Virtual Wars\" to the nameless skit about bouncing gorillas, these absurdly funny segments are brimming with excitement.

The central character, Shinji, is a boy who loves to draw. In elementary school, he encounters Masaru, a strange young boy who also loves drawing, but who draws only masked wrestlers. The two become friends. \n\nAs they progress through their elementary school grades, however, they gradually grow apart. Years later, Shinji still remains true to his dream of becoming a manga artist, and goes on to study art at the university. When his work is selected for a Best Young Artist Award, he decides to move to Tokyo and soon gets his first breakthrough. What awaits him there, though, is something completely different from the manga artist’s life that he had imagined. One day, for the first time in years, the 30-year-old Shinji comes across some work of his old friend Masaru, who has remained true to his drawing style. \n\nThe story is a mockumentary (\"mock documentary\"), and the narration is interspersed with monologues by Shinji's mother. As the central character grows, the animation style evolves from juvenile drawings doodled on random pieces of paper to sketches drawn on specialized manga paper, thus visualizing the flow of time.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)","background":"Winner of the Excellence Award at the 23rd Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2560,"type":"anime","name":"Nekonigashi Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2560/Nekonigashi_Inc"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39007,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39007/Kawauso_Labo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/98252l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kawauso Labo"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"カワウソラボ"}],"title":"Kawauso Labo","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"カワウソラボ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Other","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":1,"year":2019},"to":{"day":16,"month":7,"year":2019}},"string":"Jan 15, 2019 to Jul 16, 2019"},"duration":"Unknown","rating":"G -

Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.\n\nWhen he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The anime covers chapters 1 to 53 of the manga.

Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone.\n\nSeveral millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months.

It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:10","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1747,"type":"anime","name":"Twin Engine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1747/Twin_Engine"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":858,"type":"anime","name":"Wit Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":38671,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38671/Enen_no_Shouboutai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1664/103275l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"9uT5Iw2d0q4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uT5Iw2d0q4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uT5Iw2d0q4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9uT5Iw2d0q4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9uT5Iw2d0q4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9uT5Iw2d0q4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9uT5Iw2d0q4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9uT5Iw2d0q4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Enen no Shouboutai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Fire Brigade of Flames"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"炎炎ノ消防隊"},{"type":"English","title":"Fire Force"},{"type":"German","title":"Fire Force"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Fire Force"},{"type":"French","title":"Fire Force"}],"title":"Enen no Shouboutai","title_english":"Fire Force","title_japanese":"炎炎ノ消防隊","title_synonyms":["Fire Brigade of Flames"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":7,"year":2019},"to":{"day":28,"month":12,"year":2019}},"string":"Jul 6, 2019 to Dec 28, 2019"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.71,"scored_by":696996,"rank":1156,"popularity":100,"members":1290219,"favorites":9209,"synopsis":"Spontaneous Human Combustion: a chaotic phenomenon that has plagued humanity for years, randomly transforming ordinary people into flaming, violent creatures known as Infernals. While Infernals make up the first-generation accounts of Human Combustion, the second and third generations became known as pyrokinetics—people gifted with the ability to manipulate and control their flames while remaining human. To combat the Infernal threat and discover the cause, the Tokyo Armed Forces, Fire Defense Agency, and Holy Church of Sol produced their answer: the Special Fire Force.\n\nYoung and eager third-generation pyrokinetic Shinra Kusakabe, nicknamed Devil's Footprints for his explosive ability to ignite his feet at will, becomes a member of the lively Special Fire Force Company 8. Upholding the brigade's duty to extinguish the blazing Infernals and lay their souls to rest, Shinra is determined to become a hero who will save the lives of those threatened by the flame terror.\n\nHowever, this is not the hero's game Shinra imagined. The Fire Force is a fractured mess of feuding brigades, abnormal Infernal sightings are increasing all over Tokyo, and a shadowy group is claiming to have answers to the strange fire that caused the death of Shinra's family 12 years ago.

To combat the rampant crime lurking in the city's shadows, a new department was established in the San-Teresa Metropolitan Police.\n\nFormer JSDF soldier Kei Matoba is one of the best cops that the department has to offer, despite his inclination to occasionally bend the rules. After a fairy trafficking case goes wrong, Kei loses Rick Fury, his friend and partner of four years, setting him on a quest for vengeance.

Ni no Kuni was the first feature-length work directed by Studio Ghibli's animator Yoshiyuki Momose, who has served as the director of animation in addition to having drawn character designs and storyboards for the games. Moreover, the film features a score from Studio Ghibli's collaborator and composer Joe Hisaishi, who has also acted as the lead composer for the games' music. While the film's narrative differs from the plot in the games, the movie's story includes elements from the games such as the setting, racial diversity among the characters, names, and visual references to particular individuals and items.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39495,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39495/Totsukuni_no_Shoujo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1675/104684l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"HPQin-uuI9o","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPQin-uuI9o","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPQin-uuI9o?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HPQin-uuI9o/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HPQin-uuI9o/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HPQin-uuI9o/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HPQin-uuI9o/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/HPQin-uuI9o/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Totsukuni no Shoujo"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Foreign Girl"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"とつくにの少女"},{"type":"English","title":"The Girl From the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún"}],"title":"Totsukuni no Shoujo","title_english":"The Girl From the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún","title_japanese":"とつくにの少女","title_synonyms":["Foreign Girl"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":9,"year":2019},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 10, 2019"},"duration":"10 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.55,"scored_by":19583,"rank":1611,"popularity":2835,"members":55814,"favorites":230,"synopsis":"Let not an Outsider touch thee,\nLest thou shalt be cursed forever.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far away that was divided into two realms...\nThe Outside was roamed by teratomorphic creatures who had the power to curse whoever they touched.

In an attempt to suppress their power, the Lord of Heaven sends the Spirit Pearl to Earth to reincarnate as Ne Zha, the third son of Li Jing, while the Demon Orb is scheduled to be destroyed by a lightning strike. However, because of a conspiracy by the Dragon King to steal the Spirit Pearl for his own son, Ne Zha is instead reincarnated with the Demon Orb.\n\nWith no way to remove the cursed effects of the Demon Orb, Ne Zha is raised under the belief that he will become the great demon hunter the Spirit Pearl destined for him to be. Fighting against his chaotic and mischievous nature, Ne Zha must decide whether to accept his evil fate or rebel against it to prove he is worthy of the future his parents foretold.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The film tells the mythological origins of Nezha, who is a protection deity in Chinese folk religion, and its story is loosely based on the literary version of the myth that forms two chapters of Investiture of the Gods, a Ming-dynasty shenmo novel, traditionally attributed to Xu Zhonglin, which incorporates various existing myths into a wider narrative. The story has been adapted for the screen many times before, at least as early as 1927 or 1928, whether on its own (as in the 1979 traditionally-animated film Nezha Conquers the Dragon King) or as part of adaptations of the whole of Investiture of the Gods (such as the 2016 live-action film League of Gods).","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":2285,"type":"anime","name":"Horgos Coloroom Pictures Co., Ltd.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2285/Horgos_Coloroom_Pictures_Co_Ltd"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1809,"type":"anime","name":"October Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1809/October_Media"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39995,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39995/Super_Senko-san_Time_Episode_12","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/101663l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Super Senko-san Time Episode 12"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"第12話 スーパー仙狐さんタイム"}],"title":"Super Senko-san Time Episode 12","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"第12話 スーパー仙狐さんタイム","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"Web manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2019},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 25, 2019"},"duration":"1 min","rating":"PG-13 -

It's up to the three of them to find the additional club members they need and become an idol group strong enough to qualify for the Prism Stage and to win it as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1869,"type":"anime","name":"Bit Promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1869/Bit_Promotion"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":96,"type":"anime","name":"Yumeta Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/96/Yumeta_Company"},{"mal_id":894,"type":"anime","name":"Graphinica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/894/Graphinica"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":60,"type":"anime","name":"Idols (Female)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":40369,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40369/Mini_Yuri","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1606/116670l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mini Yuri"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"みにゆり"}],"title":"Mini Yuri","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"みにゆり","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2019},"to":{"day":16,"month":10,"year":2019}},"string":"Sep 25, 2019 to Oct 16, 2019"},"duration":"5 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.73,"scored_by":4448,"rank":5385,"popularity":6086,"members":10451,"favorites":9,"synopsis":"Mini Yuri is a four-episode series with a runtime of 5 minutes per episode.

Beyond the domes exist vicious lycanthropes who thrive in the darkness; among the citizens inside, a clear distinction between the nobility and commoners is in place. The blood of nobles enables them to utilize mana, granting them abilities that exceed human limits and greatly assist them in defeating lycanthropes.\n\nAlready 13 years of age, noble Melida Angel has yet to manifest her mana, and attends an elite academy where she is mistreated for her lack thereof. In order to help her, Kufa Vampir is ordered by the Angel family to become Melida's tutor. While Kufa seems to be a mere mentor, an ulterior motive lurks behind his job—he is to assassinate her if he confirms that she does not possess mana.\n\nKufa's investigation eventually leads him to determine he must eliminate Melida. However, Kufa is struck by her unwavering determination, spirit, and belief in herself when he witnesses her in a fight, choosing instead to offer a way she can manifest her magic. As Melida learns to use mana with the help of Kufa's teachings, Kufa forsakes his mission and jeopardizes everything to keep his discovery of Melida unknown to the Angel family and his own guild. However, both Kufa and Melida will soon realize that hiding their secret will not be the only challenge they face, as unforeseen trouble is waiting just around the corner. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1602,"type":"anime","name":"GYAO!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1602/GYAO"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1787,"type":"anime","name":"KLab","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1787/KLab"},{"mal_id":2107,"type":"anime","name":"entama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2107/entama"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1264,"type":"anime","name":"EMT Squared","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1264/EMT_Squared"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39468,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39468/Honzuki_no_Gekokujou__Shisho_ni_Naru_Tame_ni_wa_Shudan_wo_Erandeiraremasen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/101697l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"KfPyxG-ZbFM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPyxG-ZbFM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfPyxG-ZbFM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KfPyxG-ZbFM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KfPyxG-ZbFM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KfPyxG-ZbFM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KfPyxG-ZbFM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KfPyxG-ZbFM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"本好きの下剋上 ～司書になるためには手段を選んでいられません～"},{"type":"English","title":"Ascendance of a Bookworm"},{"type":"German","title":"Ascendance of a Bookworm"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Ascendance of a Bookworm"},{"type":"French","title":"Ascendance of a Bookworm"}],"title":"Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen","title_english":"Ascendance of a Bookworm","title_japanese":"本好きの下剋上 ～司書になるためには手段を選んでいられません～","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":14,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":10,"year":2019},"to":{"day":26,"month":12,"year":2019}},"string":"Oct 3, 2019 to Dec 26, 2019"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.99,"scored_by":153023,"rank":620,"popularity":785,"members":293931,"favorites":2706,"synopsis":"Urano Motosu loves books and has an endless desire to read literature, no matter the subject.

Completely caught up in hilarious antics with his new friends, Yuiga finds that his last year of high school now includes a lot more than just going to class and studying.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":2101,"type":"anime","name":"ADK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2101/ADK"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1873,"type":"anime","name":"Silver","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1873/Silver"},{"mal_id":1874,"type":"anime","name":"Arvo Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1874/Arvo_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":38084,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38084/Fate_Grand_Order__Zettai_Majuu_Sensen_Babylonia","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1194/103420l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"BIZN34WMi5E","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIZN34WMi5E","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIZN34WMi5E?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BIZN34WMi5E/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BIZN34WMi5E/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BIZN34WMi5E/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BIZN34WMi5E/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BIZN34WMi5E/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fate/Grand Order: Zettai Majuu Sensen Babylonia"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Fate/Grand Order -絶対魔獣戦線バビロニア-"},{"type":"English","title":"Fate/Grand Order: Absolute Demonic Front - Babylonia"},{"type":"German","title":"Fate/Grand Order: Absolute Demonic Front - Babylonia"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Fate/Grand Order: Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia"},{"type":"French","title":"Fate/Grand Order: Absolute Demonic Front - Babylonia"}],"title":"Fate/Grand Order: Zettai Majuu Sensen Babylonia","title_english":"Fate/Grand Order: Absolute Demonic Front - Babylonia","title_japanese":"Fate/Grand Order -絶対魔獣戦線バビロニア-","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":21,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":10,"year":2019},"to":{"day":21,"month":3,"year":2020}},"string":"Oct 5, 2019 to Mar 21, 2020"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.94,"scored_by":129285,"rank":698,"popularity":848,"members":273258,"favorites":2513,"synopsis":"A.D. 2016, the foundations of humanity have been incinerated by the Mage King Solomon.

Meanwhile, Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn—three ships from the union—stumble upon Ayanami, a spy from the Red Axis.

However, there is something far more frightening than his ominous reputation: the fact that he is immortal. This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji's body.\n\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji's assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\n\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin's desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":37498,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37498/Black_Fox","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1904/119291l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"tJ84EzUrU-4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ84EzUrU-4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJ84EzUrU-4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tJ84EzUrU-4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tJ84EzUrU-4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tJ84EzUrU-4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tJ84EzUrU-4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tJ84EzUrU-4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Black Fox"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"BLACKFOX"},{"type":"English","title":"Blackfox"}],"title":"Black Fox","title_english":"Blackfox","title_japanese":"BLACKFOX","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":10,"year":2019},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 5, 2019"},"duration":"1 hr 30 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.69,"scored_by":33421,"rank":5586,"popularity":2305,"members":79930,"favorites":143,"synopsis":"Rikka Isurugi has spent her life training in the way of the ninja with her grandfather Hyoe while following in the footsteps of her father, the esteemed researcher Allen.

However, contrary to history, powerful dragons once ruled over this world of creatures and humans but have since disappeared. Consequently, a diabolical group under the alias \"Nine,\" who seek the miracles of the once godlike dragons, stirs up trouble in the streets of Tokyo, commiting mass murder and causing destruction. To combat the dangerous group of Nine, the police organize the Special 7—a group of highly skilled professionals whose abilities exceed those of ordinary humans. \n\nCaught up in a bank robbery turned hostage crisis, Seiji Nanatsuki, having recently become a detective, has a chance encounter with Shiori Ichinose, a member of Special 7. Assisting with the resolution of the robbery, Seiji is recognized for his clear sense of justice and refreshing character, suddenly earning him a spot on the elite unit. \n\nAs he takes on new missions, Seiji finds that being a detective as part of Special 7 isn't the police work he expected, where working alongside a team of different species with special abilities and vibrant personalities brings unpredictability to his daily life and police work. While the everyday crime in Tokyo continues, Seiji and the Special 7 will fight not only to resolve special cases, but also obstruct the ill-intentioned plans of the merciless group of Nine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"21:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 21:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":167,"type":"anime","name":"Sega","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/167/Sega"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1041,"type":"anime","name":"Ai Addiction","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1041/Ai_Addiction"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1840,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"},{"mal_id":1985,"type":"anime","name":"Toyo Recording","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1985/Toyo_Recording"},{"mal_id":1986,"type":"anime","name":"arma bianca","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1983,"type":"anime","name":"Anima&Co.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1983/Anima_Co"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39811,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39811/Fairy_Gone_Part_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1799/114023l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"wyRe8jpZXwU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRe8jpZXwU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyRe8jpZXwU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyRe8jpZXwU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyRe8jpZXwU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyRe8jpZXwU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyRe8jpZXwU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyRe8jpZXwU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fairy Gone Part 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Fairy Gone 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Fairy gone フェアリーゴーン 第2期"},{"type":"English","title":"Fairy gone Season 1 Part 2"}],"title":"Fairy Gone Part 2","title_english":"Fairy gone Season 1 Part 2","title_japanese":"Fairy gone フェアリーゴーン 第2期","title_synonyms":["Fairy Gone 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":10,"year":2019},"to":{"day":23,"month":12,"year":2019}},"string":"Oct 7, 2019 to Dec 23, 2019"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

He has never had a girlfriend and he spends his late nights fantasizing about women whose pictures he leers at on the internet. His own life appalls him, but he has one escape – his online life.

He encounters a young woman in a chat forum named Sae Mi, who offers him advice. He soon falls for her charms – which makes things complicated to say the least. And things get even more bizarre when he attempts to take revenge on Sang Woo, a school bully who turns out to be Sae Mi’s older brother!\n\n(Source: Viki)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":999,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Animal","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/999/Studio_Animal"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":65,"type":"anime","name":"Magical Sex Shift","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/65/Magical_Sex_Shift"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39194,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39194/Shin_Chuuka_Ichiban","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1195/116871l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"p5FDjD2TfUQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5FDjD2TfUQ","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5FDjD2TfUQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/p5FDjD2TfUQ/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/p5FDjD2TfUQ/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/p5FDjD2TfUQ/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/p5FDjD2TfUQ/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/p5FDjD2TfUQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shin Chuuka Ichiban!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"New Cooking Master Boy"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"真・中華一番!"},{"type":"English","title":"True Cooking Master Boy"}],"title":"Shin Chuuka Ichiban!","title_english":"True Cooking Master Boy","title_japanese":"真・中華一番!","title_synonyms":["New Cooking Master Boy"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2019-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":10,"year":2019},"to":{"day":28,"month":12,"year":2019}},"string":"Oct 12, 2019 to Dec 28, 2019"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.43,"scored_by":4047,"rank":7052,"popularity":5835,"members":11566,"favorites":9,"synopsis":"After passing the Guangzhou Special Chef Trials, Mao decided to travel around China, to learn more about the unique preparation of food.
