Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  \n\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the \"Partner Killer.\" Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Khara","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/47/Khara"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Ultra Super Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1123,"type":"anime","name":"Lucent Pictures Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1123/Lucent_Pictures_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":1415,"type":"anime","name":"Asahi Broadcasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1415/Asahi_Broadcasting"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1496,"type":"anime","name":"Lawson","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1496/Lawson"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":2018,"type":"anime","name":"Rialto Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2018/Rialto_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"},{"mal_id":803,"type":"anime","name":"Trigger","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/803/Trigger"},{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":35120,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35120/Devilman__Crybaby","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/89973l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ww06yGPM7Kc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww06yGPM7Kc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ww06yGPM7Kc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww06yGPM7Kc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww06yGPM7Kc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww06yGPM7Kc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww06yGPM7Kc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww06yGPM7Kc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Devilman: Crybaby"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"DEVILMAN crybaby"},{"type":"English","title":"Devilman: Crybaby"},{"type":"German","title":"DEVILMAN: Crybaby"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"DEVILMAN: Crybaby"},{"type":"French","title":"DEVILMAN: Crybaby"}],"title":"Devilman: Crybaby","title_english":"Devilman: Crybaby","title_japanese":"DEVILMAN crybaby","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Manga","episodes":10,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":1,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jan 5, 2018"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.75,"scored_by":675489,"rank":1049,"popularity":126,"members":1112394,"favorites":23554,"synopsis":"Devils cannot take form without a living host.

Unfortunately, Yuzu's dreams and style do not conform with her new ultrastrict, all-girls school, filled with obedient shut-ins and overachieving grade-skippers.

As crimes in Cremona begin to escalate, from stealthy executions of wrongdoers to sophisticated strikes on public figures, it soon becomes clear that there is more than one person responsible.\n\nWith the help of his impulsive sidekick Lily Hoshina, and unexpected aid from the elusive Killer B himself, Keith begins to unravel plots involving secret organizations, domestic terrorism, and human experiments. When the involvement of the RIS extends beyond the scope of justice, the extent of the government's corruption—as well as the trustworthiness of close allies—are thrown into question. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1977,"type":"anime","name":"Netflix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1977/Netflix"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":35222,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35222/Gakuen_Babysitters","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89978l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"5boy-B9STZA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5boy-B9STZA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5boy-B9STZA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5boy-B9STZA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5boy-B9STZA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5boy-B9STZA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5boy-B9STZA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5boy-B9STZA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gakuen Babysitters"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"学園ベビーシッターズ"},{"type":"English","title":"School Babysitters"},{"type":"German","title":"School Babysitters"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"School Babysitters (Gakuen Babysitters)"},{"type":"French","title":"School Babysitters"}],"title":"Gakuen Babysitters","title_english":"School Babysitters","title_japanese":"学園ベビーシッターズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":2018},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2018}},"string":"Jan 7, 2018 to Mar 25, 2018"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.9,"scored_by":165619,"rank":747,"popularity":688,"members":328941,"favorites":3096,"synopsis":"After losing both parents in a fatal plane crash, teenager Ryuuichi Kashima must adjust to his new life as the guardian of his younger brother Kotarou.

As her sole albeit unwilling investor, his life is now directly linked to Hitomi's ability to participate in underground bloodsport matches known only as Killing Bites.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"02:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 02:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1337,"type":"anime","name":"Medicos Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1337/Medicos_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1358,"type":"anime","name":"Fields","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1358/Fields"},{"mal_id":1787,"type":"anime","name":"KLab","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1787/KLab"},{"mal_id":2223,"type":"anime","name":"Christmas Holly","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2223/Christmas_Holly"},{"mal_id":2225,"type":"anime","name":"C-one","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2225/C-one"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":36548,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36548/Kokkoku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"nsv2ymwJlvE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsv2ymwJlvE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsv2ymwJlvE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsv2ymwJlvE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsv2ymwJlvE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsv2ymwJlvE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsv2ymwJlvE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nsv2ymwJlvE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kokkoku"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"刻刻"},{"type":"English","title":"Kokkoku"}],"title":"Kokkoku","title_english":"Kokkoku","title_japanese":"刻刻","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2018},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":2018}},"string":"Jan 8, 2018 to Mar 26, 2018"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.99,"scored_by":70838,"rank":4205,"popularity":1246,"members":183117,"favorites":330,"synopsis":"After presumably failing 19 job interviews in one day, Juri Yukawa's dreams of moving out of her parents' home are utterly dashed.

Or, at the very least, they pretend to be the city's defenders. In reality, the Colors are just three young girls: the shy Yui Akamatsu, the noisy Sacchan, and the video game-loving Kotoha, who spend their time playing make-believe and exploring the city. The Colors' activities are facilitated by the grandfatherly Daigorou \"Pops\" Kujiraoka, who uses his store's inventory of knick-knacks to entertain the rambunctious trio.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of the Colors though. The local policeman Saitou just wants to deal with his regular duties, but he often finds himself the target of the Colors' attention, having been made the villain in most of their fantasies. But despite his personal feelings, Saitou always finds the time to go along with the three girls' games. Even though the Colors do not actually defend Ueno, they definitely help brighten everyone's day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1254,"type":"anime","name":"Grooove","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1254/Grooove"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":36688,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36688/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament_Departures","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1395/95778l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"EMpuVrwbBX8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMpuVrwbBX8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMpuVrwbBX8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EMpuVrwbBX8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EMpuVrwbBX8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EMpuVrwbBX8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EMpuVrwbBX8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EMpuVrwbBX8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shinmai Maou no Testament Departures"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"新妹魔王の契約者 DEPARTURES"},{"type":"English","title":"The Testament of Sister New Devil Departures"},{"type":"German","title":"The Testament of Sister New Devil Departures"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"The Testament of Sister New Devil OVA: Departures"},{"type":"French","title":"The Testament of Sister New Devil Departures"}],"title":"Shinmai Maou no Testament Departures","title_english":"The Testament of Sister New Devil Departures","title_japanese":"新妹魔王の契約者 DEPARTURES","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":28,"month":3,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 28, 2018"},"duration":"59 min","rating":"R+ -

Although she makes a disastrous first impression, Hana soon befriends two of her classmates: the gentle and studious class representative Saaya Yakushiji, and a cool and mysterious girl Homare Kagayaki.\n\nThat night, a magical baby falls from the sky right onto Hana's balcony. She is immediately smitten with her and names her Hug-tan. Alongside Hug-tan is a snarky talking hamster, Hariham Harry, who mutters that Hana \"isn't the one\" before vanishing with the baby.\n\nThe next day, Hana believes the encounter to be a dream, until people all over the city begin collapsing and a giant monster appears, feeding on their energy. As Hana escapes, she spots Hug-tan and Harry under attack. Making a stand to protect them, she and Hug-tan suddenly both glow with energy and a heart-shaped gem forms.\n\nWith the crystal's power, Hana transforms into a hero called \"Cure Yell\" and defeats the monster. Surprised at Hana's power, Harry explains that he and Hug-tan came from a future frozen in time by the Criasu Corporation, the same organization that created the monster. Only the Future Crystals, manifestations of one's hopes and dreams, and the Precure they create have a chance at defeating Criasu and saving the future!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"08:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 08:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1415,"type":"anime","name":"Asahi Broadcasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1415/Asahi_Broadcasting"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":1522,"type":"anime","name":"Echoes","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1522/Echoes"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37278,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37278/Sword_Art_Online_Fatal_Bullet__The_Third_Episode_-_Pilot-ban","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot-ban"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet -The Third Episode- ＜パイロット版＞"},{"type":"English","title":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot"}],"title":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot-ban","title_english":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot","title_japanese":"Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet -The Third Episode- ＜パイロット版＞","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":2,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Feb 8, 2018"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.91,"scored_by":4435,"rank":9682,"popularity":5187,"members":15514,"favorites":40,"synopsis":"A special movie said to be inspired by the Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet video game.

Out of desperation she turns to the message board Free Friends to earn some money. She develops a relationship with her first partner, Kaito, without realizing that they're much more than strangers...\n\nKaito, the newest student teacher at Minatohashi Higashi Academy, has a vice. Unable and unwilling to form meaningful, intimate relationships with other people, he instead satiates his need for intimacy through compensated dating. In order to feed this habit, he uses a message board known as Free Friends. Through its services, he can make the necessary arrangements and appointments with the various girls who also use the site, mainly students running away from home or simply in need of extra income.\n\nHis troubles trace back to a deeply seated complex: a hollow, yearning feeling brought on by the thought and sight of violets. Violets, or \"Sumire\", remind him of the sister he'd been separated from during their childhood when their parents had divorced. Only by losing himself in a woman's body can he rid himself of those clinging, nostalgic feelings.\n\nRight before the school year begins, the mere reminder of the academy's famed violet flowerbeds (despite them not even being in bloom at the time) is enough to drive Kaito to Free Friends. A seemingly routine exchange leaves him completely unprepared for the girl waiting for him: an absolutely stunning beauty by the pseudonym of \"Sumi\".\n\nA few days later, he discovers that \"Sumi\" is not only a student at the exact same school he teaches at, but that her classmates call her \"Sumire\". Incredulous, Kaito checks the school rosters. Surely it's not the same Sumire he knows; surely it's just another girl with the same given name? But as if setting him up for the universe's biggest punchline, the only Sumire at the school is none other than his very own Shinozaki Sumire, the sister his mother had taken away from him. Kaito's dreams of one day reuniting with his sister have in fact already been realized... just not in a way that he ever could have imagined.\n\n(Source: VNDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":365,"type":"anime","name":"PoRO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/365/PoRO"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37663,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37663/God_Eater_Reso_Nantoka_Gekijou__Nagerareta_Shokupan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1587/95137l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"God Eater Reso Nantoka Gekijou: Nagerareta Shokupan"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"God Eater Reso Nantoka Gekijou: Episode 00"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"GOD EATER レゾなんとか劇場 #00.「投げられた食パン」"}],"title":"God Eater Reso Nantoka Gekijou: Nagerareta Shokupan","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"GOD EATER レゾなんとか劇場 #00.「投げられた食パン」","title_synonyms":["God Eater Reso Nantoka Gekijou: Episode 00"],"type":"Special","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":24,"month":3,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 24, 2018"},"duration":"7 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.69,"scored_by":975,"rank":10646,"popularity":7674,"members":5847,"favorites":2,"synopsis":"Short anime inspired by the iOS and Android mobile game God Eater Resonant Ops.\n\nIntroduces the characters through their first day of school.

Her plan goes instantly awry, though, when she runs into Hirotaka Nifuji, an old friend from middle school. Although she tries to keep her secret by inviting him out for drinks after work, her cover is blown when he casually asks her whether or not she will be attending the upcoming Summer Comiket. Luckily for her, the only witnesses—Hanako Koyanagi and Tarou Kabakura—are otaku as well.\n            \nLater that night, the pair go out for drinks so that they can catch up after all the years apart.

He makes a solemn promise to always be there for her, to support her, and to help her farm for rare drops in Monster Hunter. Blown away by the proposal, Narumi agrees immediately.

One day, a drunken companion tells Sugimoto the tale of a man who murdered a group of Ainu and stole a fortune in gold. Before his arrest by the police, he hid the gold somewhere in Hokkaido. The only clue to its location is the coded map he tattooed on the bodies of his cellmates in exchange for a share of the treasure, should they manage to escape and find it.\n\nSugimoto does not think much of the tale until he discovers the drunken man's corpse bearing the same tattoos described in the story. But before he can collect his thoughts, a grizzly bear—the cause of the man's demise—approaches Sugimoto, intent on finishing her meal. He is saved by a young Ainu girl named Asirpa, whose father happened to be one of the murdered Ainu. With Asirpa's hunting skills and Sugimoto's survival instincts, the pair agree to join forces and find the hidden treasure—one to get back what was rightfully her people's, and the other to fulfill his friend's dying wish.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1261,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1747,"type":"anime","name":"Twin Engine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1747/Twin_Engine"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1393,"type":"anime","name":"Geno Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1393/Geno_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":36793,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36793/3D_Kanojo__Real_Girl","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/93616l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"NIHvbYdxdfo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIHvbYdxdfo","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIHvbYdxdfo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/NIHvbYdxdfo/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/NIHvbYdxdfo/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/NIHvbYdxdfo/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/NIHvbYdxdfo/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/NIHvbYdxdfo/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"3D Kanojo: Real Girl"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"3D Girlfriend"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"３Ｄ彼女　リアルガール"},{"type":"English","title":"Real Girl"}],"title":"3D Kanojo: Real Girl","title_english":"Real Girl","title_japanese":"３Ｄ彼女　リアルガール","title_synonyms":["3D Girlfriend"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2018},"to":{"day":20,"month":6,"year":2018}},"string":"Apr 4, 2018 to Jun 20, 2018"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.85,"scored_by":165139,"rank":4775,"popularity":682,"members":332054,"favorites":1568,"synopsis":"For Hikari Tsutsui, life within the two-dimensional realm is much simpler.

Aoi valiantly refuses and decides to settle things on her own terms: she will pay off the debt herself by opening an eatery at Oodanna's inn.\n\nKakuriyo no Yadomeshi follows the journey of Aoi as she proceeds to change and touch the lives of the ayakashi through the one weapon she has against them—her delicious cooking.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Gourmet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]},{"mal_id":35756,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35756/Comic_Girls","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1207/91794l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"iWIpU_htE0Y","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWIpU_htE0Y","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWIpU_htE0Y?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/iWIpU_htE0Y/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/iWIpU_htE0Y/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/iWIpU_htE0Y/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/iWIpU_htE0Y/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/iWIpU_htE0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Comic Girls"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"こみっくがーるず"}],"title":"Comic Girls","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"こみっくがーるず","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2018},"to":{"day":21,"month":6,"year":2018}},"string":"Apr 5, 2018 to Jun 21, 2018"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.37,"scored_by":59042,"rank":2309,"popularity":1542,"members":141336,"favorites":702,"synopsis":"Kaoruko \"Chaos\" Moeta is a young manga artist who is down on her luck.

She soon meets the other residents: Tsubasa Katsuki, a shounen manga artist; Ruki Irokawa, who draws erotic manga popular with women; and Koyume Koizuka, a shoujo artist who, like Chaos, has yet to be serialized. Quickly striking up a friendship with these girls, Chaos finds new inspiration for her manga and continues to grow her creativity.\n\nComic Girls is a showcase of the daily lives of these manga artists.

Together, they will use their newfound powers and weapons granted by their emotions—known as the Catharsis Effect—to fight off the mysterious group known as The Ostinato Musicians as they struggle to escape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":1201,"type":"anime","name":"Ponycan USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1201/Ponycan_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Satelight","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":36934,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36934/Captain_Tsubasa_2018","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/91270l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"K6zQ1qs2hLY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6zQ1qs2hLY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6zQ1qs2hLY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/K6zQ1qs2hLY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/K6zQ1qs2hLY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/K6zQ1qs2hLY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/K6zQ1qs2hLY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/K6zQ1qs2hLY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Captain Tsubasa (2018)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"キャプテン翼"},{"type":"German","title":"Captain Tsubasa"},{"type":"French","title":"Captain Tsubasa"}],"title":"Captain Tsubasa (2018)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"キャプテン翼","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":4,"year":2018},"to":{"day":2,"month":4,"year":2019}},"string":"Apr 3, 2018 to Apr 2, 2019"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.41,"scored_by":32137,"rank":2121,"popularity":2431,"members":72969,"favorites":350,"synopsis":"Captain Tsubasa is the passionate story of an elementary school student whose thoughts and dreams revolve almost entirely around the love of soccer. 11-year-old Tsubasa Oozora started playing football at a very young age, and while it was mostly just a recreational sport for his friends, for him, it developed into something of an obsession. \n\nIn order to pursue his dream to the best of his elementary school abilities, Tsubasa moves with his mother to Nankatsu city, which is well-known for its excellent elementary school soccer teams.

Amazed by her astounding intellect and intuition, he invites her to a private meeting where he introduces her to the concept of Slave Control Method, or SCM, a retainer-like device that has the ability to turn people into slaves.\n\nWhen two SCM users enter a duel, the devices exert a powerful influence on their brains.

Though hesitant at first, Yuuga’s words resonate with her personal yearning for something more from her life, and she agrees to his request.

A select few among mankind took to the stars in a spacefaring vessel called the Aratrum in search of \"the promised land,\" the planet Tau-e that could sustain human life. But the migration plan fails, and the remnants of the human race decide to return to Earth. But the distortions in space-time and the distance traveled means that mankind is returning to a completely changed Earth some 20,000 years later. The returnees, led by hero Haruo, prepare to take the fight to Godzilla based on a strategy that has been 20 years in the making. Carried out with the help of two alien species, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, the humans succeed in defeating Godzilla in a costly battle to the death.\n\nBut the victory is short-lived. Rising from the depths of the planet is a new breed of monster, dubbed \"Godzilla Earth.\" Evolving for 20,000 years, the creature stands 300 meters high, weighs over 100,000 tons and wields such overwhelmingly destructive power that Haruo and company have no choice but to run for their lives.\n\nComing to Haruo's rescue, however, is Miana, a member of an aboriginal tribe called the Houtua. They are the first humanoid people the returnees have encountered. Could they descend from humans? \"Our tribal god was destroyed by Godzilla. All that we have left are these eggs.

After only the first couple of practices, Daigo's lack of talent and inherent baseball sense shows, and his confidence is crushed. Unable to bear the pressure of living up to his father, a baseball prodigy, he quits the team in less than a year.\n\nTwo years later, now in sixth-grade, a transfer student joins Daigo's class. This student turns out to be Hikaru, the son of Gorou's lifelong friend and fellow baseball star, Toshiya Satou. One day, Daigo's mother receives a call from the Dolphins requesting players for a game, so she forces Daigo to attend. To Daigo's surprise, he finds Hikaru there. Even more shocking is that despite his father's occupation, Hikaru has never played baseball before!\n\nUnlike Daigo, though, Hikaru immediately picks up the game demonstrating excellent performance. Needless to say, Daigo and Hikaru are polar opposites of each other.

He has no interest in others and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, titled Living with Dying. He soon identifies it as a secret diary belonging to his popular, bubbly classmate Sakura Yamauchi. She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is an anime adaption of Yoru Sumino's novel of the same title.

A visitor approaches, and suddenly, the fog recedes. A shape begins to take form beside the board—this figure is the masked Storyteller, who once again starts to spin tales of horror and despair.\n\nThe events described in these macabre tales might happen to anyone, even your neighbors or friends: a group of girls bully one of their members in a cave, only to find themselves the victims of a dark presence; a boy with scopophobia moves to the countryside, but he still cannot escape the eyes of others; a man has a window that won't stay closed, and is the recipient of strange phone calls; and a salaryman steals an umbrella on a rainy day, but this seemingly insignificant act leads to consequences he never expected. Visitors may enjoy the Storyteller's offerings, but they should also be vigilant so that they don't wind up as the subjects of his next story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"04:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 04:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1169,"type":"anime","name":"ILCA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1169/ILCA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37304,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37304/K__Seven_Stories_Movie_3_-_Side_Green_-_Uwagaki_Sekai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/91000l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"oFDVuY8W6WU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDVuY8W6WU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFDVuY8W6WU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/oFDVuY8W6WU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/oFDVuY8W6WU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/oFDVuY8W6WU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/oFDVuY8W6WU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/oFDVuY8W6WU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"K: Seven Stories Movie 3 - Side:Green - Uwagaki Sekai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"K: Seven Stories - Side:Green - The Overwritten World"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"K Seven Stories SIDE:GREEN ~上書き世界~"},{"type":"English","title":"K: SEVEN STORIES \"SIDE:GREEN - Overwrite World - \""}],"title":"K: Seven Stories Movie 3 - Side:Green - Uwagaki Sekai","title_english":"K: SEVEN STORIES \"SIDE:GREEN - Overwrite World - \"","title_japanese":"K Seven Stories SIDE:GREEN ~上書き世界~","title_synonyms":["K: Seven Stories - Side:Green - The Overwritten World"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 1, 2018"},"duration":"59 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.15,"scored_by":5845,"rank":3414,"popularity":4648,"members":20550,"favorites":18,"synopsis":"Sukuna Gojo is a boy who ran away from his wealthy home after becoming disgusted by his controlling parents.

Because the area is prone to fire and flooding, residents rent everyday items like pots, futons, and clothing from shops instead of purchasing them, so as not to impede them when they flee. Obeni and Seiji, an older sister and younger brother, run one such rental shop called Izumoya. However, mixed in with their inventory are tsukumogami, objects that have turned into spirits after a hundred years of existence. The siblings sometimes lend these sentient items to customers. Both Obeni and Seiji can see and talk to these spirits, and other tsukumogami often come to the store after hearing of the famed siblings. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:10","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":737,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"},{"mal_id":1285,"type":"anime","name":"Being","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1285/Being"},{"mal_id":1397,"type":"anime","name":"Universal Music Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1397/Universal_Music_Japan"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1797,"type":"anime","name":"NHK Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":94,"type":"anime","name":"Telecom Animation Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/94/Telecom_Animation_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":38034,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38034/Tiny_Evil","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1817/104328l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tiny Evil"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Tiny Evil"}],"title":"Tiny Evil","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"Tiny Evil","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2018},"to":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2019}},"string":"Sep 28, 2018 to Feb 22, 2019"},"duration":"17 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":7.08,"scored_by":8725,"rank":null,"popularity":4898,"members":18217,"favorites":120,"synopsis":"In a last-ditch effort to lose his virginity and die right after, Takeshi draws a demonic circle in hopes of summoning a succubus to wring him dry.

After an intense back and forth from both sides, the fate of Seishun's advancement in the competition rests on the shoulders of their team captain. Refusing to let Hyoutei be defeated this early in the tournament, Atobe is determined to defeat Tezuka by exposing and exploiting his weakness.\n\nInui-Kaidou vs. Shishido-Ootori / Oishi-Kikumaru vs. Niou-Yagyuu\nEmboldened by their invigorated efforts, Sadaharu Inui and Kaoru Kaidou compete with Hyoutei's Ryou Shishido and Choutarou Ootori as Seishun's newly formed doubles pair. Prior to the match, Inui proposes to Kaidou that they team up in order to elevate their playstyle and go beyond what they are currently capable of. Meanwhile, Shishido, who had just managed to get back onto the regular team, is resolved to prove that he deserves his position and must win no matter the cost.\n\nKnown as Seishun's \"Golden Pair,\" Eiji Kikumaru and Shuichiro Oishi face off against Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Masaharu Niou and Hiroshi Yagyuu at the Kanto Regional Finals. While the game starts off smoothly for Seishun, Niou and Yagyuu begin to employ various strategies that make the game progressively harder to win. As the Golden Pair struggle against their opponents, the history behind the duo begins to unfold.\n\nFuji vs. Kirihara\nIn the Singles 2 event at the Kanto Regional finals, Seishun's \"Genius\" Shuusuke Fuji contends with Rikkai's second-year ace Akaya Kirihara. Kirihara boldly declares he will win the match within 13 minutes, a statement which Fuji cannot help but scoff at. As the match begins to draw out longer than anticipated, Kirihara resorts to a more violent playstyle. Backed into a corner, Fuji must quickly adapt if he wants to claim victory over Kirihara.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Tennis no Oujisama franchise, three of the most popular matchups in the series, as voted by fans, were reanimated.

It is a rare disease which only affects teenagers, and its symptoms are so supernatural that hardly anyone recognizes it as a legitimate occurrence. However, high school student Sakuta Azusagawa knows from personal experience that it is very much real, and happens to be quite prevalent in his school.\n\nMai Sakurajima is a third-year high school student who gained fame in her youth as a child actress, but recently halted her promising career for reasons unknown to the public. With an air of unapproachability, she is well known throughout the school, but none dare interact with her—that is until Sakuta sees her wandering the library in a bunny girl costume. Despite the getup, no one seems to notice her, and after confronting her, he realizes that she is another victim of Puberty Syndrome. As Sakuta tries to help Mai through her predicament, his actions bring him into contact with more girls afflicted with the elusive disease.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai adapts the first 5 volumes of Hajime Kamoshida's Seishun Buta Yarou Series light novels.","season":"fall","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"02:20","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 02:20 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37430,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"bkQkyzXEXKE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkQkyzXEXKE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bkQkyzXEXKE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bkQkyzXEXKE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bkQkyzXEXKE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bkQkyzXEXKE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bkQkyzXEXKE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bkQkyzXEXKE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"TenSura"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"転生したらスライムだった件"},{"type":"English","title":"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"},{"type":"German","title":"That Time I Got Reincamrnated as a Slime"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"},{"type":"French","title":"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"}],"title":"Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken","title_english":"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime","title_japanese":"転生したらスライムだった件","title_synonyms":["TenSura"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2019-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":10,"year":2018},"to":{"day":19,"month":3,"year":2019}},"string":"Oct 2, 2018 to Mar 19, 2019"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.14,"scored_by":841694,"rank":437,"popularity":89,"members":1381959,"favorites":28885,"synopsis":"Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate worker, who is perfectly content with his monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout his life. In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes.

He is an accomplished actor, with 20 years of experience under his belt, and is aware his good looks are well above average. Proud of his career, Takato regards the title as an appropriate indicator of his success.\n\nBut when his reign is ended by acting newbie Junta Azumaya, who debuted only three years ago, Takato's initial shock gives way to jealous hostility. Even in the new drama that he has been cast in, Junta seems to have suddenly surpassed him; snatching Takato's usual spot of lead actor, Junta continually manages to get on his nerves. Most infuriating of all are the bright smile and kind words that accompany everything Junta does.\n\nAll this animosity comes to a head, however, when Junta catches Takato in a rather vulnerable drunken state. Endangering his own public image, Takato confronts the junior actor with harsh words and angry comments—an opportunity Junta takes every advantage of.

Mankind has lost the battle for planet Earth to Godzilla, and has taken to the stars in search of a new home. But the search ends in vain, forcing them and their alien allies back to Earth. But 20,000 years have passed in their absence, and the Earth is a wholly different place.\n\nThe planet's flora and fauna now embody and serve Godzilla. Earth is a monster's planet, ruled by the largest Godzilla ever at 300 meters in height. Godzilla Earth.\n\nHuman protagonist, Captain Haruo, yearns to defeat Godzilla and retake the planet for mankind. There, he meets aboriginal descendants of the human race, the Houtua tribe. The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone's surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \"Mecha-Godzilla City,\" a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\n\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers – namely, the nanometal integration – but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\n\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \"ultimate goal.\" Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind's next move.\n\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\n\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo's eyes? Find out in the finale.\n\n(Source: Official site)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1023,"type":"anime","name":"Polygon Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1023/Polygon_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37826,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37826/Osake_wa_Fuufu_ni_Natte_kara__Yuzu_Atsukan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/95350l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara: Yuzu Atsukan"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara Special"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Love is Like a Cocktail Episode 14"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"お酒は夫婦になってから 14杯め「ゆず熱燗」"}],"title":"Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara: Yuzu Atsukan","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"お酒は夫婦になってから 14杯め「ゆず熱燗」","title_synonyms":["Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara Special","Love is Like a Cocktail Episode 14"],"type":"ONA","source":"Web manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 6, 2018"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"PG-13 -

Unable to stop himself, he starts sneaking into her room at night, admiring his sister's body and pleasing himself to her. Akira becomes increasingly frustrated with the distance between them; but when Yui reveals that a friend from school has confessed to her, something snaps inside him.\n\nNo longer restricting himself to mere daydreams, he actively has intercourse with his sleeping sister.

He despises the attention he draws at school with his bouts of loud hyperventilating, extended coughing fits, and exemption from physical education as well as military service. Whether suffering through the curiosity or ire of his classmates, Myeongyi is left feeling like a complete outcast. However, the class president Han Seonho often shows Myeongyi kindness and understanding. With his friendly gestures and handsome looks, he becomes Myeongyi's first crush.\n\nNine years later, Myeongyi attends his high school reunion for only one reason: to see Han Seonho once again. He holds a tiny glimmer of hope about the other man's feelings for him—but after seeing the bright gold ring on Seonho's left hand and listening to their classmates' prying questions, that hope is quickly dashed. Excusing himself to go take a smoke, regardless of the state of his lungs, Myeongyi is followed outside by Seonho. Unexpectedly, that marks the beginning of their illicit love affair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hyperventilation Special was included in the official DVD release on October 5, 2018.
