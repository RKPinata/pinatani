Overall a pleasant film that's interesting to watch for the technical aspects; but the story leaves much to be desired, being on the melodramatic-maudlin side. The later Dezaki/Sugino version is very different, with 52 episodes for the story to breathe in and far more compelling storytelling.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":18061,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/18061/Tiger_Mask_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74485l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tiger Mask (Movie)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"タイガーマスク"}],"title":"Tiger Mask (Movie)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"タイガーマスク","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1970-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":3,"year":1970},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 17, 1970"},"duration":"47 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.15,"scored_by":268,"rank":8476,"popularity":12781,"members":1054,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Re-edit of Episode 9&amp;10.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":54,"type":"anime","name":"Combat Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":12789,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12789/Yasashii_Lion","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1238/112799l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yasashii Lion"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Kindly Lion"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Gentle Lion"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"やさしいライオン"}],"title":"Yasashii Lion","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"やさしいライオン","title_synonyms":["The Kindly Lion","The Gentle Lion"],"type":"Movie","source":"Picture book","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1970-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":3,"year":1970},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 21, 1970"},"duration":"27 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.46,"scored_by":439,"rank":11472,"popularity":13104,"members":958,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"This is an animated version of Yanase Takashi's picture book featuring the friendship between a mother dog, Muku-muku, who lost her puppy, and the baby lion Buru-buru, who lost her mother.

Although greatly outnumbered, he effortlessly defeats them, drawing the attention of Danpei Tange—a former boxing coach turned alcoholic. Seeing his potential, he offers to train Joe into Japan's greatest boxer. At first, Joe dismisses Danpei as a hopeless drunk; but after the trainer saves his life, he agrees to live with him and learn the art of boxing. Unfortunately, Joe's personality makes him an unruly student, and he often falls back to his old ways.\n\nTo survive the harsh world of his new career, Joe needs to trust his mentor and master the techniques taught to him.

Headstrong school bad boy Shingo Tamai and his friend Ohira are determined not to be bullied into joining Matsuki's team; instead they set up a squad of their own, and at first play just for fun and struggle to keep up with Matsuki's team. \n\nAs their skills progress, they play other teams and get stronger and craftier, until they face the crack Asakase high school squad and its star player Misugi Yan in the schools' final. In a tangle of subplots involving old rivalries and injuries, and a mixed-race player seeking his identity and his lost mother (who turns out to be in jail), Shingo develops his skills as a center forward and looks forward to playing a visiting Brazilian squad. He is seriously injured in a game, but his talent, which even the legendary Brazilian Pele recognizes, is equaled by his determination. With the help of a friend of his old rival Matsuki, he recovers to help the team to victory. \n\nDefinitely melodrama rather than a sports series proper, this is the first in the line of Japanese soccer soaps that stretches to Captain Tsubasa and beyond.
