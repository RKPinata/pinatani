After angering a group of thugs, Dororo is attacked by them, but a mysterious man interrupts them, claiming to hear spirits nearby. Sure enough, a monster emerges from the river, and the man then removes his prosthetic arms, revealing blades hidden underneath, with which he slays the monster before leaving.\n\nThat night, as the man walks through the forest, Dororo approaches him and declares that he will accompany him. From this, the man, Hyakkimaru, reveals that many of his body parts were stolen by demons and that though he sought a peaceful life, he couldn't escape their relentless onslaught. Despite the tale, Dororo still insists on tagging along.

When the two wake, however, they are met by the owner of the home and are tragically separated.\n\nOsamu Tezuka's lustful tale follows Aladdin and Miriam as they struggle to reunite with each other while facing the trials of a strange and magical world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Senya Ichiya Monogatari is the first installation in a trilogy of experimental adult-oriented films, Animerama. It takes direct inspiration from the Middle Eastern folk tale compilation One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of stories that was first published in Arabic in 1775 but with a literary history predating the 10th century. At the time of its release, Senya Ichiya Monogatari was the longest animated film sitting at 130 minutes. It was also the first X-rated animation in Japan and claims to be the first erotic animated feature film. The film was first distributed by Nippon Herald Films as a 10th anniversary special beginning in June 1969. In 2018, Third Window Films distributed 2,000 limited-edition Blu-ray copies—alongside the second installment of Animerama, Tezuka's Cleopatra—and bundled it with an interview featuring the director and other audio commentaries. The English dubbed version, recorded in Italy, was released by anime distributor Discotek Media in November 2020.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Mushi Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5023,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5023/Ninpuu_Kamui_Gaiden","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/22957l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kamui the Ninja: Stories Other Than the Legend"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kamui the Ninja"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"忍風カムイ外伝"}],"title":"Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"忍風カムイ外伝","title_synonyms":["Kamui the Ninja: Stories Other Than the Legend","Kamui the Ninja"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1969-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1969-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":4,"year":1969},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":1969}},"string":"Apr 6, 1969 to Sep 28, 1969"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.03,"scored_by":421,"rank":4015,"popularity":10579,"members":2237,"favorites":10,"synopsis":"Kamui is a ninja from the Edo period who has decided to leave his clan.
