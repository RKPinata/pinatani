Her father had fallen in love with a red dragon he intended to kill, and instead of slaying the dragon, he married her. Their union gave birth to Mink, who inherited horns, a tail, retractable wings, and incredible strength—characteristics which signify her dragon half nature. \n\nMink spends her days accompanied by her friend Pia, a dwarf girl with overprotective parents, and her best friend Lufa, an elf with great healing powers but impressively bad magic. The three find themselves mooning over the dreamy and charming dragonslayer, Dick Saucer. But in a sudden, absurd turn of events, Mink gets closer than ever to the object of her fantasies, only to realize that her love may never be reciprocated because of her dragon heritage.\n\nThus, the trio sets out on a quest to find a potion that will make Mink fully human. They may unwittingly make enemies, but they are sure to have one heck of a good time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Dragon Half is a two-episode original video animation consisting of Dragon Half: Mink's Journey and Dragon Half (Final): The Brutal Killer Martial Arts Tournament, adapting the first two volumes of the manga and released two months apart. Four episodes were planned, but the anime did not garner enough interest to justify a continued production. Dragon Half spawned a videogame of the same name for the TurboGraphx-16 console, or the PC Engine. The game utilizes the storyline of the anime. The voice actors from the anime reprise their roles in the game. The show received an English dubbing, of which ADV Films released on VHS in 2000, and then on DVD that same year.

Taku arrives, and Matsuno introduces him to Rikako Muto, a beautiful girl from Tokyo who recently transferred to their school. Although Rikako is academically and athletically gifted, her generally unpleasant attitude leaves her with virtually no friends outside of Matsuno and another girl from her class.\n\nAfter a chance encounter during their class trip, Taku suddenly finds himself more involved in Rikako's personal life, much to Matsuno's dismay. Struggling to balance his friendship with Matsuno and his own budding infatuation for Rikako, Taku must come to terms with his feelings and understand how a girl with a troubled past is having such a massive effect on his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1016,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1016/Gunnm","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/41257l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gunnm"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ganmu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tsutsu Yume: Gunnm"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Battle Angel"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hyper Future Vision: Gunnm"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"銃夢 GUNNM"},{"type":"English","title":"Battle Angel Alita"}],"title":"Gunnm","title_english":"Battle Angel Alita","title_japanese":"銃夢 GUNNM","title_synonyms":["Ganmu","Tsutsu Yume: Gunnm","Battle Angel","Hyper Future Vision: Gunnm"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1993-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1993-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":6,"year":1993},"to":{"day":21,"month":8,"year":1993}},"string":"Jun 21, 1993 to Aug 21, 1993"},"duration":"30 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.07,"scored_by":27977,"rank":3825,"popularity":2731,"members":59740,"favorites":257,"synopsis":"Doc Ido, a doctor and mechanic who lives and works in the hellish, postapocalyptic \"Scrapyard,\" finds the—miraculously preserved—remains of a female cyborg in a junk heap.

But the end of the war does not mean the end of hardship for her.

Soon, after certain events, Hanamichi is left with two unwavering thoughts: \"I hate basketball,\" and \"I desperately need a girlfriend.\"\n\nOne day, a girl named Haruko Akagi approaches him without any knowledge of his troublemaking ways and asks him if he likes basketball. Hanamichi immediately falls head over heels in love with her, blurting out a fervent affirmative. She then leads him to the gymnasium, where she asks him if he can do a slam dunk. In an attempt to impress Haruko, he makes the leap, but overshoots, instead slamming his head straight into the blackboard. When Haruko informs the basketball team's captain of Hanamichi's near-inhuman physical capabilities, he slowly finds himself drawn into the camaraderie and competition of the sport he had previously held resentment for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1993,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":666,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/666/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1171/106036l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OVA 1"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ジョジョの奇妙な冒険"},{"type":"English","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"},{"type":"French","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"}],"title":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken","title_english":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure","title_japanese":"ジョジョの奇妙な冒険","title_synonyms":["JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OVA 1"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":6,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1993-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1994-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":11,"year":1993},"to":{"day":18,"month":11,"year":1994}},"string":"Nov 19, 1993 to Nov 18, 1994"},"duration":"35 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.46,"scored_by":55723,"rank":1952,"popularity":1696,"members":125516,"favorites":1728,"synopsis":"Kujo Jotaro is a normal, popular Japanese high-schooler, until he thinks that he is possessed by a spirit, and locks himself in prison.
