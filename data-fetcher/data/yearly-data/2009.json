Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.\n\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \"Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you can't put out this fire.\"\n\nAnd as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \"What do you think you are doing?\" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \"I am doing what I can.\"\n\n(Source: sechangersoi.be)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":52443,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52443/Between_Showers","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1682/125543l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Between Showers"}],"title":"Between Showers","title_english":null,"title_japanese":null,"title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"2009"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":15571,"popularity":20970,"members":115,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"This year, it sudden shower a lot.

Equally skilled in combat, mutual admiration for one another causes these two feuding warriors to forge a fierce rivalry, thwarting any attempts to form a united front against the Demon King of Owari. \n\nWith Oda's forces closing in on their respective territories, Masamune and Yukimura reluctantly learn to put aside their differences and fight together against the threatening usurpator.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Sengoku Basara is based off of a series of hack-and-slash fighting games by Capcom.","season":"spring","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2952,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2952/Final_Fantasy_VII__Advent_Children_Complete","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1065/94641l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Qy9hiWlk8yk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy9hiWlk8yk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qy9hiWlk8yk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qy9hiWlk8yk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qy9hiWlk8yk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qy9hiWlk8yk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qy9hiWlk8yk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qy9hiWlk8yk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children Complete"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ファイナルファンタジーVII アドベントチルドレンコンプリート"},{"type":"German","title":"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children"},{"type":"French","title":"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"}],"title":"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ファイナルファンタジーVII アドベントチルドレンコンプリート","title_synonyms":["Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children Complete"],"type":"OVA","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":4,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 16, 2009"},"duration":"2 hr 6 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.9,"scored_by":81980,"rank":746,"popularity":1639,"members":130701,"favorites":761,"synopsis":"Two years after saving the world from a cataclysmic event, the members of the activist organization Avalanche have gone their separate ways.

Hiding his true identity and remaining enigmatic, Arawn pledges his power and leadership to the tribe's cause and joins Arthur, Riannon, and their merry band of friends—including a talented swordsman, an agile hunter, and a group of ecstatic pixies—as they fight back against the Empire, while uncovering the dark secrets of the land along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Episode 1 was pre-aired online on April 3rd.

However, the unit's sole surviving member Nadya Ruslanova suffers from memory loss and is unlikely to take part in any combat operation.\n\nThe next Moment of Truth—an event that happens once every 700 years, when the actions of a single man can change the entire course of history—is rapidly approaching the Eastern Front. In hopes of breaking the stalemate at the frontlines, a German occult organization called Ahnenerbe plans to summon Baron von Wolff, a medieval knight from the Northern Crusades, and his undead army from the underworld. To prevent this from happening, First Squad must gather once again, and it is up to Nadya to bring back her deceased friends to stop the Nazis from taking over the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":488,"type":"anime","name":"Anchor Bay Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/488/Anchor_Bay_Films"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Studio 4°C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/13/Studio_4%C2%B0C"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5772,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5772/Akaneiro_ni_Somaru_Saka__Hardcore","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12090l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka: Hardcore"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Akasaka OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あかね色に染まる坂 Hardcore"},{"type":"English","title":"Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka Hardcore OVA"}],"title":"Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka: Hardcore","title_english":"Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka Hardcore OVA","title_japanese":"あかね色に染まる坂 Hardcore","title_synonyms":["Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka OVA","Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka OVA","Akasaka OVA"],"type":"Special","source":"Visual novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":6,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 26, 2009"},"duration":"26 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.39,"scored_by":21617,"rank":7233,"popularity":3400,"members":40051,"favorites":30,"synopsis":"Everybody goes on vacation to Ayanokouji's private island for fun in the sun.

As they search for the ring, Urin becomes separated from the other two and accidently breaks the seal on a stone coffin, releasing an evil being known as Sedna. Sensing Sedna's release, the formerly missing turtle elder, Matsumoto, reveals himself to Kanon and her companions, naming Marin as the Priestess of the Sea. Together with the Priestess of the Sky, she has the power to seal Sedna away again. And as luck would have it, during an encounter with one of Sedna's minions, Kanon discovers that she is the Priestess of the Sky. Though Kanon is hesitant, she and Marin decide to work together to save the world from the evil that threatens it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":218,"type":"anime","name":"Zexcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6151,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6151/Final_Fantasy_VII__On_the_Way_to_a_Smile_-_Episode__Denzel","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51623l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Final Fantasy VII: On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"デンゼルを中心としたオリジナルアニメ"}],"title":"Final Fantasy VII: On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"デンゼルを中心としたオリジナルアニメ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":4,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 16, 2009"},"duration":"28 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.09,"scored_by":12872,"rank":3705,"popularity":4215,"members":25889,"favorites":11,"synopsis":"After the three-pronged conflict between tyrannical electric company Shinra, rebel group Avalanche, and the maniacal Sephiroth, the damaged planet slowly heals its wounds.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4657,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4657/Arad_Senki__Slap_Up_Party","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/134025l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Arad Senki: Slap Up Party"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Slap Up Party Arad Senki"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dungeon & Fighter - The Animation"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dungeon & Fighter - Arad Senki"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"アラド戦記 ～スラップアップパーティー～"}],"title":"Arad Senki: Slap Up Party","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"アラド戦記 ～スラップアップパーティー～","title_synonyms":["Slap Up Party Arad Senki","Dungeon & Fighter - The Animation","Dungeon & Fighter - Arad Senki"],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2009-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2009},"to":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":2009}},"string":"Apr 4, 2009 to Sep 26, 2009"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.69,"scored_by":6117,"rank":5583,"popularity":5061,"members":16668,"favorites":32,"synopsis":"The anime will follow the adventures of Baron, a man living on continent of Arad in the year 981 after \"the cursed light of Kazan\" has fallen across the land.

These charms were created by three magicians in a magical world names Jewel Land, each housing one of its many native Jewelpets. Although these creatures are free to roam the world in their original form, the magicians sometimes turn them into charms so that they can be carried around with great ease. Most Jewelpets don't find this troublesome, but once a mischievous bunny by the name of Ruby feels overly claustrophobic, she devises her escape.\n\nOne day, the magicians decide to move the Jewelpets, and task a pelican with delivering them to the Dream Forest. All is well until a strong gust of wind disorients the bird, who then drops all of the charms that he was carrying. Instead of heading towards the Dream Forest, all the Jewelpets but Ruby fall to Rinko's home city on Earth. Someone must go and retrieve them all, and as Ruby was the worst-behaved of the bunch, she is given the task of going to Earth.\n\nWhen Ruby reaches Earth in the form of a red Jewel Charm, she falls into Rinko's water glass, and thus begins a rather unexpected adventure. Rinko, Minami, and Ruby form an alliance to search and gather all of the fallen charms, encountering strange creatures and tons of helpful allies along the way.

Veteran voice actress Minami Takayama (Detective Conan's Conan, Kiki's Delivery Service's Kiki and Ursula) plays the lovestruck boy Shōta alongside fellow cast members Yuki Tashiro, Daisuke Sakaguchi (Clannad's Youhei Sunohara), and Akeno Watanabe (To Love-Ru's Rito Yūki). \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"},{"mal_id":313,"type":"anime","name":"Omnibus Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/313/Omnibus_Japan"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"Educational","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/56/Educational"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37547,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37547/Onikiri_Shoujo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/91251l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Onikiri Shoujo"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"鬼斬少女"}],"title":"Onikiri Shoujo","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"鬼斬少女","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":6,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 15, 2009"},"duration":"1 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":4.9,"scored_by":272,"rank":12632,"popularity":15357,"members":507,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A rough earlier rendition of Onikiri Musume Saisen.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":27455,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/27455/Porong_Porong_Pororo_3","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/66621l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Porong Porong Pororo 3"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"뽀롱뽀롱 뽀로로 3"},{"type":"English","title":"Pororo the Little Penguin 3"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Pororo el Pequeño Pingüino Serie 3"}],"title":"Porong Porong Pororo 3","title_english":"Pororo the Little Penguin 3","title_japanese":"뽀롱뽀롱 뽀로로 3","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2009-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":5,"year":2009},"to":{"day":27,"month":10,"year":2009}},"string":"May 4, 2009 to Oct 27, 2009"},"duration":"5 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.61,"scored_by":197,"rank":10980,"popularity":15453,"members":495,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A direct continuation of the second season.

Satoshi must now prevent the destruction of the entire human race, as Arceus' fury causes distortions in the fabric of the universe, enraging the Legendary trio—Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina—and disturbing the world's balance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"},{"mal_id":499,"type":"anime","name":"The Pokemon Company International","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/499/The_Pokemon_Company_International"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":7017,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7017/K-On__Ura-On","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/23479l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"K-On!: Ura-On!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"K-On!

The archaeologists identify it as being made by Mak-zi (also known as \"McFat\"), an ancient Chinese philosopher who had invented many things, but were arguably ahead of its time - for example, a myriad of electronic devices before the discovery of electricity. However, the crudeness of the artifact has led to the artifact being rejected for every museum in China and abroad, and thus, unwilling to destroy it, the artifact was set on a barge, continuously moving along the Yangtze River. The story continues on to Mak-zi's descendant 18 generations later, McDull (Kwok Kwan Yin), a kindergartener living in Hong Kong.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":445,"type":"anime","name":"Bliss Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/445/Bliss_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":32775,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32775/Gene","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/78610l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gene"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"gene"}],"title":"Gene","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"gene","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Music","source":"Music","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2009},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 3, 2009"},"duration":"5 min","rating":"G -

Amid the race to find the shards, Inuyasha and his brother Sesshoumaru must also resolve their feud and cooperate for their final confrontation with Naraku, as it is a battle they must win in order to put a stop to his evil and cruelty once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:20","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:20 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/76/Yomiuri_Telecasting"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Love Polygon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":6512,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6512/Nyan_Koi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18299l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nyan Koi!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nyankoi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"にゃんこい！"},{"type":"English","title":"Nyan Koi!"}],"title":"Nyan Koi!","title_english":"Nyan Koi!","title_japanese":"にゃんこい！","title_synonyms":["Nyankoi"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2009-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":10,"year":2009},"to":{"day":18,"month":12,"year":2009}},"string":"Oct 2, 2009 to Dec 18, 2009"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.13,"scored_by":134836,"rank":3515,"popularity":888,"members":262110,"favorites":589,"synopsis":"Junpei Kousaka is a second-year high school student who has an allergy for cats—a predicament that has made him hate cats and everything related to them.

While curing his patients in questionable ways, Dr. Irabu often tries to gain something from them outside of his profession—and in doing so, occasionally forgets his role as a doctor.\n\nAs each patient struggles to face the nature of their distress, an obvious yet invisible thread ties their paths together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":517,"type":"anime","name":"Asmik Ace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/517/Asmik_Ace"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1619,"type":"anime","name":"Bungeishunjuu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1619/Bungeishunjuu"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"Medical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6572,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6572/Shakugan_no_Shana_S","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17680l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shakugan no Shana S"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shakugan no Shana OVA 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"灼眼のシャナS"},{"type":"English","title":"Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"}],"title":"Shakugan no Shana S","title_english":"Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series","title_japanese":"灼眼のシャナS","title_synonyms":["Shakugan no Shana OVA 2"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2009-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2010-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":23,"month":10,"year":2009},"to":{"day":29,"month":9,"year":2010}},"string":"Oct 23, 2009 to Sep 29, 2010"},"duration":"28 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.34,"scored_by":40997,"rank":2430,"popularity":2236,"members":83691,"favorites":102,"synopsis":"Find out what happens when Yuji accidentally triggers a found Treasure Tool while it's pointed at Shana!

At the time of the short's release, 21-year-old Ishida was studying animation at Kyoto Seika University; primarily animated using Adobe After Effects, his project was uploaded to YouTube in 2009 and quickly garnered a viral status. Fumiko no Kokuhaku won the Best Film Award at the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2010 and received an Excellence Award at the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival later that year, the latter event citing the film's \"exhilaration\" and polished animation. In 2018, Ishida would go on to direct the acclaimed full-scale film Penguin Highway. As of 2020, Fumiko no Kokuhaku remains available for purchase on DVD. With the DVD comes a soft-cover book detailing the animation process. Additionally, the animation can be found on Blu-ray, bundled with Ishida's 2011 short Rain Town, among other original net animations.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6287,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6287/Akikan__Kan_Ippatsu_Onsen_Panic","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1548/119396l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Akikan!: Kan Ippatsu!?
