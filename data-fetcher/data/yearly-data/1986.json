Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power.

The pangolin explains the situation and tells the old man the legend of seven calabashes that can save their land from being destroyed. The old man knows what he must do and obtains the legendary calabash plant seed in order to defeat the demons.\n\nAs each calabash matures, it transforms into a child with unique powers.  With a combined effort, these seven calabash brothers set on a mission to defeat the demons in a 13 episode-long adventure.\n\nIn a sequel series, it is later revealed that there was a third demon, specifically the sister to the snake spirit, that had been in hiding underground during the whole battle. The only survivor from the defeat of the two demons, a humanoid toad with a blinded eye, comes and desperately reports the news. Naturally, the demon is enraged and attacks the mountain that contains the seven brothers in order to avenge its siblings' deaths.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":471,"type":"anime","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/471/Shanghai_Animation_Film_Studio"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":17835,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/17835/Seito_Shokun_Kokoro_ni_Midori_no_Neckerchief_wo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/47527l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Seito Shokun!

When a certain number have learned (and Keyes suggests an arbitrary figure of 100), not only do the remaining monkeys suddenly appear to know how to do it, but so too does a completely different group of apes on a completely separate island.

With their land separating Itha and Paro, they risk getting caught in the crossfire of an upcoming battle. Yet there is one among them that does not share such fear. Izu—an ambitious, energetic young man—sees this war as an opportunity to gain fame and wealth. Enticed by Paro's promise of a generous reward, he readily answers the kingdom's call for help, vowing to his beloved wife Marin that they will soon reunite.\n\nFeeling heartbroken, Marin becomes engrossed in prayer for her husband's safe return. Meanwhile, Ahnas and Jill are determined to not let their positions or their families' hostilities come between them. But will these young people's genuine love prevail over human foolishness and vices, or will it be sacrificed to petty ambitions?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Although the story was originally conceived for the production of an anime, Windaria first appeared as a novel titled Douwa Meita Senshi Windaria four months prior to the movie's release. As stated in the postscript, the author believed this reading would further entice people to watch the film. The movie was broadcasted several times on Yomiuri TV's Anime Daisuki! program. An English version was made available under the title Once Upon a Time by Harmony Gold in 1987. However, in order to make it suitable for a younger audience, major changes were made: the exclusion of some nudity and violent scenes, modification of the script, new character names, and added narration. In Japan, Windaria was initially distributed to home video by Victor Entertainment, which later released it on DVD on December 16, 2000. In the US, it was made available on VHS as Windaria by Streamline Pictures on August 1, 1993, and on DVD as Once Upon a Time by ADV Films on March 16, 2004. Additionally, a video game adaptation titled Dungeon of Windaria was released in Japan by Nintendo on May 15, 2008.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":2278,"type":"anime","name":"Harmony Gold","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"},{"mal_id":2518,"type":"anime","name":"Streamline Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2518/Streamline_Pictures"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":288,"type":"anime","name":"Kaname Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/288/Kaname_Productions"},{"mal_id":1943,"type":"anime","name":"Idol","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1943/Idol"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2060,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2060/Gall_Force_1__Eternal_Story","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1720/121339l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gall Force 1: Eternal Story"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ガルフォース"},{"type":"English","title":"Gall Force 1: Eternal Story"}],"title":"Gall Force 1: Eternal Story","title_english":"Gall Force 1: Eternal Story","title_japanese":"ガルフォース","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1986-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":28,"month":7,"year":1986},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 28, 1986"},"duration":"1 hr 26 min","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.4,"scored_by":2470,"rank":7182,"popularity":7132,"members":7042,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"Two advanced civilizations, the Paranoids (a race of alien humanoids) and the Solenoids (who are all women) are waging a war that has gone on for centuries.

In the end, it is up to the remaining crew Star Leaf to defend the artificial paradise of Chaos from the Paranoid fleet and the plans of the Solenoid leaders.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"},{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Artmic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/72/Artmic"},{"mal_id":155,"type":"anime","name":"animate Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3127,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3127/California_Crisis__Tsuigeki_no_Juuka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/97046l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juuka"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juka"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juuka [Hibana]"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"カリフォルニア・クライシス　追撃の銃火"},{"type":"English","title":"California Crisis: Gun Salvo"}],"title":"California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juuka","title_english":"California Crisis: Gun Salvo","title_japanese":"カリフォルニア・クライシス　追撃の銃火","title_synonyms":["California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juka","California Crisis: Tsuigeki no Juuka [Hibana]"],"type":"OVA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1986-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":7,"year":1986},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 21, 1986"},"duration":"45 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.63,"scored_by":3069,"rank":10900,"popularity":7222,"members":6800,"favorites":13,"synopsis":"One hundred miles south of Los Angeles, a reckless biker named Marcia and her newfound acquaintance Noera crash their vehicles after getting caught in the explosion of a semi truck.
