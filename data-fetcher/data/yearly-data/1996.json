The Phoenix chooses a story entitled \"Old Woman\" (\"Oba-chan\") from numerous episodes of \"Black Jack\" to discuss the theme of how much love can grow in this short lifetime. In the story, there is a seemingly greedy old woman who is always asking her daughter-in-law for money, and her son and his wife become fed up with the old woman's behaviour. Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. \n\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. \n\nNot aware of his mother's act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son's life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.\n\n(Source: official site)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":458,"type":"anime","name":"Beijing Sharaku Art","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/458/Beijing_Sharaku_Art"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"Medical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":1820,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1820/Power_Dolls","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1602/97126l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Power Dolls"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Powerdolls: Detachment of Limited Line Services"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Women Of Mass Destruction"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"パワードール"}],"title":"Power Dolls","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"パワードール","title_synonyms":["Powerdolls: Detachment of Limited Line Services","Women Of Mass Destruction"],"type":"OVA","source":"Game","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1998-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":3,"year":1996},"to":{"day":1,"month":3,"year":1998}},"string":"Mar 1, 1996 to Mar 1, 1998"},"duration":"27 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":5.34,"scored_by":818,"rank":11844,"popularity":10300,"members":2427,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"In 2535 A.D., after decades of oppressive policies instituted by the Terran government, the people of the colony world Omni joined together to declare their independence from the tyranny of planet Earth.

Now this will definitely mess up his plans for Kozue, but then having his very own cutie at home sure is convenient... what's a guy to do then?\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":296,"type":"anime","name":"Critical Mass Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/296/Critical_Mass_Video"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1009,"type":"anime","name":"Aubec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1009/Aubec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4842,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4842/Doukyuusei_2_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/70153l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Doukyuusei 2 (OVA)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Classmates 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"同級生2"},{"type":"English","title":"End of Summer 2"}],"title":"Doukyuusei 2 (OVA)","title_english":"End of Summer 2","title_japanese":"同級生2","title_synonyms":["Classmates 2"],"type":"OVA","source":"Visual novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1996-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":22,"month":3,"year":1996},"to":{"day":18,"month":12,"year":1996}},"string":"Mar 22, 1996 to Dec 18, 1996"},"duration":"29 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":5.63,"scored_by":504,"rank":null,"popularity":10776,"members":2102,"favorites":2,"synopsis":"Based on a game by Elf.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"},{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"KSS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2646,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2646/Dorami___Doraemons__Robot_Schools_Seven_Mysteries","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1257/134133l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dorami & Doraemons: Robot School's Seven Mysteries"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dorami & Doraemons: Robot Gakkou Nanafushigi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ドラミ＆ドラえもんズ ロボット学校七不思議！？"}],"title":"Dorami & Doraemons: Robot School's Seven Mysteries","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ドラミ＆ドラえもんズ ロボット学校七不思議！？","title_synonyms":["Dorami & Doraemons: Robot Gakkou Nanafushigi"],"type":"Movie","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":3,"year":1996},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 2, 1996"},"duration":"31 min","rating":"PG - Children","score":6.65,"scored_by":807,"rank":5826,"popularity":11127,"members":1858,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"At the graduation day in Robot School, mysterious flow pulls in all of Dorami's friends and classmates, including Doraemon.

The first deals with a group of young women who, after being out of school for a few years, are beginning to think about settling down. However, there is one member of the group who has no prospects, and Shizuka's friends are worried that her shyness will keep Mr. Right from noticing her beauty and character. \n\nThey persuade her to join a dating service called The Wedding Club, but when her first match seems to be quite a dud, Shizuka wonders if a trip down the isle just isn't in her future. The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband. Her sisters have other ideas, though, and when a co-worker asks her out on a date, the women convince the suitor to propose marriage that very night.This is easier said than done, however, as Kiyomi's attitude can be quite intimidating. \n\nThe young man may not end up following through with the plan, but even if he does there is no guarantee that the headstrong lady in question will say yes. \n\n(Source: All Movie Guide)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2833,"type":"anime","name":"Sofix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2833/Sofix"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3425,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3425/Meiken_Lassie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51265l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Meiken Lassie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sekai Meisaku Gekijou"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Famous Dog Lassie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Great Dog Lassie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Lassie Come-Home"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"名犬ラッシー"}],"title":"Meiken Lassie","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"名犬ラッシー","title_synonyms":["Sekai Meisaku Gekijou","Famous Dog Lassie","Great Dog Lassie","Lassie Come-Home"],"type":"TV","source":"Novel","episodes":25,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1996-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":1,"year":1996},"to":{"day":18,"month":8,"year":1996}},"string":"Jan 14, 1996 to Aug 18, 1996"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.76,"scored_by":428,"rank":5229,"popularity":11232,"members":1779,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"John is a cheerful and energetic young boy, who lives in a small coal-mining town in England.

As a result, Hitomi finds herself transported to the world of Gaea, a mysterious land where the Earth hangs in the sky.\n\nIn this new land, Hitomi soon discovers that Van is a prince of the Kingdom of Fanelia, which soon falls under attack by the evil empire of Zaibach. In an attempt to fight them off, Van boards his family's ancient guymelef Escaflowne—a mechanized battle suit—but fails to defeat them, and Fanelia ends up destroyed. Now on the run, Hitomi and Van encounter a handsome Asturian knight named Allen Schezar, whom Hitomi is shocked to find looks exactly like her crush from Earth. With some new allies on their side, Van and Hitomi fight back against the forces of Zaibach as the empire strives to revive an ancient power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Escaflowne was originally planned to be a 39 episode series, but after cuts to its budget and an extensive reworking of the plot, the show was reduced to a 26 episode run. Due to time constraints, certain footage in earlier episodes were cut during its broadcast and later restored on the Japanese home video releases, referred to as the Director's Cut. The North American Bandai Entertainment releases used the TV masters, so their English dub does not sync properly with the Japanese home video masters on those specific episodes. FUNimation later licensed the series and, in 2016, launched a successful Kickstarter to redub the entirety of the Director's Cut edition.","season":"spring","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Love Polygon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":535,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/535/Slayers_Next","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1165/92536l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Slayers Next"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スレイヤーズNEXT"},{"type":"English","title":"Slayers Next"}],"title":"Slayers Next","title_english":"Slayers Next","title_japanese":"スレイヤーズNEXT","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1996-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":1996},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":1996}},"string":"Apr 5, 1996 to Sep 27, 1996"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.02,"scored_by":37211,"rank":588,"popularity":2513,"members":69475,"favorites":846,"synopsis":"In the kingdom of Xoana, Lina Inverse and Gourry Gabriev unexpectedly come across their old companions, Zelgadis Graywords and Princess Ameilia Wil Tesla Saillune.

Because of this, she had felt self-conscious about herself... especially with men who were constantly leering at her. This only intensified when she was attacked by a rapist with a breast fetish. Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":470,"type":"anime","name":"GAGA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/470/GAGA"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":26,"type":"anime","name":"Girls Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9549,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9549/Alps_no_Shoujo_Heidi__Heidi_to_Clara-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26449l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Alps no Shoujo Heidi: Heidi to Clara-hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"アルプスの少女ハイジ ハイジとクララ編"},{"type":"German","title":"Heidi: Ein Sommer voll Glück"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Heidi en la Ciudad"}],"title":"Alps no Shoujo Heidi: Heidi to Clara-hen","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"アルプスの少女ハイジ ハイジとクララ編","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":8,"year":1996},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 21, 1996"},"duration":"1 hr 29 min","rating":"PG -

He has questions no one can answer fully, but follows a girl from a chance meeting in hopes to discover any.

Meanwhile, the arrogant Ramia is plotting to overthrow Tsunami by enlisting her own magical girl—the eccentric Pixy Misa—to cause chaos and ensure that balance is never restored. As Pixy Misa terrorizes the planet with her Love-Love monsters, Sasami must learn to swallow her pride and accept her role as the universe's champion of justice, Pretty Sammy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"APPP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/77/APPP"},{"mal_id":204,"type":"anime","name":"Pioneer LDC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/204/Pioneer_LDC"},{"mal_id":210,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Tulip","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/210/Studio_Tulip"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":808,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/808/Bakuretsu_Hunters_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/97321l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bakuretsu Hunters OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ganso Bakuretsu Hunters"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"元祖　爆れつハンター"},{"type":"English","title":"Sorcerer Hunters"},{"type":"German","title":"Sorcerer Hunters"}],"title":"Bakuretsu Hunters OVA","title_english":"Sorcerer Hunters","title_japanese":"元祖　爆れつハンター","title_synonyms":["Ganso Bakuretsu Hunters"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":3,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1996-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1997-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":12,"year":1996},"to":{"day":23,"month":4,"year":1997}},"string":"Dec 21, 1996 to Apr 23, 1997"},"duration":"28 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.44,"scored_by":2678,"rank":6978,"popularity":7170,"members":6970,"favorites":10,"synopsis":"On the \"Spooner Continent\", a valiant group of Sorcerer Hunters are the people's last line of defense against the evil dark magiks unleashed periodically by those who can't control it.
