The main character of the story is Fang, who was born to a hunting dog and a circus-runaway European wolf. Although Fang was raised by a human family, he is a wild animal after all, and is destined to live amongst nature. The story reaches its climax when Fang returns from the circus and faces his foe, a giant brown bear which killed his family. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":16812,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/16812/77Danui_Bimil","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1938/112796l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"77Danui Bimil"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"77 Group's Secret"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Secret of 77 Dan"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"77단의 비밀"}],"title":"77Danui Bimil","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"77단의 비밀","title_synonyms":["77 Group's Secret","Secret of 77 Dan"],"type":"Movie","source":"Radio","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1978-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":23,"month":7,"year":1978},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 23, 1978"},"duration":"1 hr 9 min","rating":"G -

Though she has the appearance of an adult, Gel Sadra is not immune to throwing childish tantrums and behaving immaturely.\n\nIn the midst of the revival of Galactor, the Science Ninja Team is called back into action, with a shady man known as Hawk Getz acting as the replacement for Joe. Getz is quickly revealed to be a Galactor agent in disguise (and had killed the actual Getz who was to join), and winds up killed by a mysterious feather shuriken. After hints spread in the first three episodes, Joe reappears in the fourth episode, having somehow survived his fatal injuries at the end of the first series, and rejoins the team. It is later revealed that he was rescued by an ex-Galactor scientist at the brink of his death, and was the subject of various cybernetic augmentations.\n\nLater in the series, a female scientist known as Dr.Pandora is introduced, who had lost her husband and daughter in the cruise ship disaster. Unbeknown to her, her daughter Sammie survived and is in fact Gel Sadra.","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1978,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"},{"mal_id":841,"type":"anime","name":"Saban Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/841/Saban_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4509,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4509/Captain_Future__Kareinaru_Taiyokei_Race","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/8631l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Captain Future: Kareinaru Taiyokei Race"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Captain Future Kareinaru Taiyoukei Race"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Captain Future: The Great Race in the Solar System"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"キャプテンフューチャー・華麗なる太陽系レース"},{"type":"German","title":"Captain Future: A Brilliant Race over the Solar System"},{"type":"French","title":"Capitaine Flam: L'ultime Course à Travers le Système Solaire"}],"title":"Captain Future: Kareinaru Taiyokei Race","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"キャプテンフューチャー・華麗なる太陽系レース","title_synonyms":["Captain Future Kareinaru Taiyoukei Race","Captain Future: The Great Race in the Solar System"],"type":"Special","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1978-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":31,"month":12,"year":1978},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 31, 1978"},"duration":"58 min","rating":"PG-13 -
