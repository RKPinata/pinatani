If you call this number, you will hear a young man introduce himself as the Yato God.\n\nYato is a minor deity and a self-proclaimed \"Delivery God,\" who dreams of having millions of worshippers. Without a single shrine dedicated to his name, however, his goals are far from being realized. He spends his days doing odd jobs for five yen apiece, until his weapon partner becomes fed up with her useless master and deserts him.\n\nJust as things seem to be looking grim for the god, his fortune changes when a middle school girl, Hiyori Iki, supposedly saves Yato from a car accident, taking the hit for him. Remarkably, she survives, but the event has caused her soul to become loose and hence able to leave her body. Hiyori demands that Yato return her to normal, but upon learning that he needs a new partner to do so, reluctantly agrees to help him find one. And with Hiyori's help, Yato's luck may finally be turning around.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Aside from the anime and manga there is a mobile game titled Noragami -Kami to Enishi-.","season":"winter","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1041,"type":"anime","name":"Ai Addiction","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1041/Ai_Addiction"},{"mal_id":1309,"type":"anime","name":"Lawson HMV Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1309/Lawson_HMV_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1635,"type":"anime","name":"A-Sketch","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1635/A-Sketch"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":18897,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Pu-n_4CLXLA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu-n_4CLXLA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pu-n_4CLXLA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pu-n_4CLXLA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pu-n_4CLXLA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pu-n_4CLXLA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pu-n_4CLXLA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pu-n_4CLXLA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nisekoi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nisekoi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ニセコイ"},{"type":"English","title":"Nisekoi: False Love"},{"type":"German","title":"Nisekoi: False Love"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Nisekoi: False Love"},{"type":"French","title":"Nisekoi: Amours, mensonges & yakuzas!"}],"title":"Nisekoi","title_english":"Nisekoi: False Love","title_japanese":"ニセコイ","title_synonyms":["Nisekoi"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":20,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":1,"year":2014},"to":{"day":24,"month":5,"year":2014}},"string":"Jan 11, 2014 to May 24, 2014"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.57,"scored_by":648204,"rank":1531,"popularity":121,"members":1148522,"favorites":10738,"synopsis":"Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole heir to an intimidating yakuza family.

However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction between the two groups.

Throughout the Game Development Club's constant shenanigans and his desperate attempts to leave the club, Kenji begins to realize that he may be actually enjoying himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"D-Frag! adapts content from the first 5 volumes of Tomoya Haruno's manga of the same name.","season":"winter","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"},{"mal_id":737,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"},{"mal_id":882,"type":"anime","name":"Toranoana","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/882/Toranoana"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":20057,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20057/Space☆Dandy","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"hdhtVKk6-do","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdhtVKk6-do","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdhtVKk6-do?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/hdhtVKk6-do/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/hdhtVKk6-do/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/hdhtVKk6-do/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/hdhtVKk6-do/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/hdhtVKk6-do/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Space☆Dandy"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スペース☆ダンディ"},{"type":"English","title":"Space Dandy"},{"type":"German","title":"Space Dandy"}],"title":"Space☆Dandy","title_english":"Space Dandy","title_japanese":"スペース☆ダンディ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":1,"year":2014},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":2014}},"string":"Jan 5, 2014 to Mar 27, 2014"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.88,"scored_by":150113,"rank":790,"popularity":652,"members":348620,"favorites":5373,"synopsis":"Dandy is a groovy, pompadour-wearing man who explores the stars in search of strange aliens for money, desiring to visit his favorite place: BooBies, the best diner in all the cosmos.

And for Mayu, Airi, Minami, Yoshino, Nanami, Kaya and Miyu, it's going to be especially difficult knowing who to trust, as their manager Matsuda's lack of experience could give other, less scrupulous, individuals a chance to take advantage.\n\nThat's a situation that quickly comes to a head when Green Leaves' president suddenly disappears with most of the money, and things only get worse when the replacement producer seems more interested in getting the girls into revealing swimsuits than promoting their music.\n\nAs malicious gossip begins to surface regarding Mayu's past membership in a rival group, and internal tensions begin to tear the team apart, they'll need more than just ambition to survive. Singing may be a business, but friendship and a love of music is what will keep everything together.\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":"Wake Up, Girls! was announced by the production company Avex Entertainment, who helmed the series in collaboration with director Yutaka Yamamoto and voice talent agency 81 Produce.

The lowest of the sixteen—Imanity—consists of humans, a race with no affinity for magic. In a place where everything is decided through simple games, humankind seems to have no way out of their predicament—but the arrival of two outsiders poses a change.\n\nOn Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username \"Blank.\" While notorious on the internet, the pair believe that life is merely another dull game. However, after responding to a message from an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard. The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them about the world's absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and Shiro begin their search for more information and a place to stay, taking them to Elkia—Imanity's only remaining kingdom.\n\nThere, the duo encounters Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl vying for the kingdom's sovereignty. In desperation, she attempts to regain her father's throne, but her foolhardiness makes her goal unachievable. Inspired by the girl's motivation and passion, Sora and Shiro decide to aid Stephanie in getting Elkia back on its feet, ultimately aiming to become the new rulers of the enigmatic realm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"No Game No Life adapts the first three volumes of Yuu Kamiya's light novel series of the same title.","season":"spring","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"},{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":20583,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76014l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"JOGp2c7-cKc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOGp2c7-cKc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOGp2c7-cKc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOGp2c7-cKc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOGp2c7-cKc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOGp2c7-cKc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOGp2c7-cKc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOGp2c7-cKc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Haikyuu!!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High Kyuu!!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"HQ!!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハイキュー!!"},{"type":"English","title":"Haikyu!!"},{"type":"German","title":"Haikyu!!"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Haikyu!!

Even though his attempt to make his debut as a volleyball regular during a middle school tournament went up in flames, he longs to prove that his less-than-impressive height ceases to be a hindrance in the face of his sheer will and perseverance.\n\nWhen Hinata enrolls in Karasuno High School, the Little Giant's alma mater, he believes that he is one step closer to his goal of becoming a professional volleyball player. Although the school only retains a shadow of its former glory, Hinata's conviction isn't shaken until he learns that Tobio Kageyama—the prodigy who humiliated Hinata's middle school volleyball team in a crushing defeat—is now his teammate.\n\nTo fulfill his desire of leaving a mark on the realm of volleyball—so often regarded as the domain of the tall and the strong—Hinata must smooth out his differences with Kageyama. Only when Hinata learns what it takes to be a part of a team will he be able to join the race to the top in earnest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Haikyuu!! adapts the first 8 volumes of Haruichi Furudate's manga of the same name.","season":"spring","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"17:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 17:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1732,"type":"anime","name":"Spacey Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1732/Spacey_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":20899,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20899/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/55267l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ER_SrymjhHQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER_SrymjhHQ","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ER_SrymjhHQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ER_SrymjhHQ/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ER_SrymjhHQ/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ER_SrymjhHQ/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ER_SrymjhHQ/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ER_SrymjhHQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dai San Bu Kuujou Joutarou: Mirai e no Isan"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 スターダストクルセイダース"},{"type":"English","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders"},{"type":"German","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Jojo´s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders"},{"type":"French","title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders"}],"title":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","title_english":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders","title_japanese":"ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 スターダストクルセイダース","title_synonyms":["Dai San Bu Kuujou Joutarou: Mirai e no Isan","JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2014},"to":{"day":13,"month":9,"year":2014}},"string":"Apr 5, 2014 to Sep 13, 2014"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.1,"scored_by":836816,"rank":481,"popularity":115,"members":1179566,"favorites":21692,"synopsis":"Years after an ancient evil was salvaged from the depths of the sea, Joutarou Kuujou sits peacefully within a Japanese jail cell.

Although the overly confident Peco strives to be the best ping-pong player in the world, he often skips practice, earning the ire of his fellow teammates on the Katase High School ping-pong team. Meanwhile, Smile—in spite of his innate talent for the sport—cannot help but hold back his full strength when playing against others. Through their mutual love for ping-pong, the two have developed a bond that is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nWhen Peco hears that an ex-national team player from China is coming to Japan, he drags Smile over to rival Tsujido High School to observe them. The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the former in one game. Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing his potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for enjoyment.\n\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players—each with their own internal strifes—await them at the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere. But when these young athletes let their unbridled ambition go unchecked, the hardships they face paint a somber reality as they pursue glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ping Pong The Animation won the Animation of the Year award in the Television category at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival in 2015.

As they delve deeper into the mysteries of the Dark Hour, the nature of the mysterious connection that binds these two together is slowly unveiled.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":344,"type":"anime","name":"Atlus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/344/Atlus"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":26123,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26123/Seitokai_Yakuindomo_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Seitokai Yakuindomo* OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seitokai Yakuindomo 2 OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seitokai Yakuindomo* OAD"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seitokai Yakuindomo 2 OAD"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SYD* OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SYD 2 OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"生徒会役員共＊ OAD"}],"title":"Seitokai Yakuindomo* OVA","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"生徒会役員共＊ OAD","title_synonyms":["Seitokai Yakuindomo 2 OVA","Seitokai Yakuindomo* OAD","Seitokai Yakuindomo 2 OAD","SYD* OVA","SYD 2 OVA"],"type":"OVA","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":10,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2020-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":5,"year":2014},"to":{"day":17,"month":9,"year":2020}},"string":"May 16, 2014 to Sep 17, 2020"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R -

Due to an evolutionary breakthrough, the \"Solid Vision\" system is now able to provide Duel Monsters with mass.\n\nYuuya Sakaki is Yuusho Sakaki's son, the latter being the founder of You Show Duel School in Miami City. Yuusho insists that duels are not a tool of war, but rather are to bring smiles to people and thus introduced the concept of Entertainment Dueling. However, at the height of his fame, Yuusho disappears and fails to attend his duel with Strong Ishijima, the Action Duel champion. Although scarred by this sudden leave, Yuuya vows to become an Entertainment Duelist like his father.\n\nSeveral years later, in the midst of a battle with Strong Ishijima, Yuuya's desperation to win brings forth a miracle. His pendant begins glowing, turning his cards into Pendulum Cards, which enables him to perform a Pendulum Summon—a summoning method unknown to the world and himself—gaining him fame overnight. As a result, Reiji Akaba, CEO of Leo Corporation and founder of the elite Leo Duel School, starts producing new Pendulum Cards to incorporate Pendulum Summoning into the system. Thus, the mysteries that surround Pendulum Summoning and Yuuya's father start to unravel, and Yuuya learns bit by bit what it takes to become an Entertainment Duelist.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"},{"mal_id":2504,"type":"anime","name":"Konami Cross Media NY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2504/Konami_Cross_Media_NY"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":21167,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21167/Escha___Logy_no_Atelier__Tasogare_no_Sora_no_Renkinjutsushi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/61733l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"l0UilZkwg9Y","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UilZkwg9Y","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0UilZkwg9Y?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/l0UilZkwg9Y/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/l0UilZkwg9Y/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/l0UilZkwg9Y/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/l0UilZkwg9Y/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/l0UilZkwg9Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Escha & Logy no Atelier: Tasogare no Sora no Renkinjutsushi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"エスカ&ロジーのアトリエ ～黄昏の空の錬金術士～"},{"type":"German","title":"Atelier Escha und Logy"}],"title":"Escha & Logy no Atelier: Tasogare no Sora no Renkinjutsushi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"エスカ&ロジーのアトリエ ～黄昏の空の錬金術士～","title_synonyms":["Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky"],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":4,"year":2014},"to":{"day":26,"month":6,"year":2014}},"string":"Apr 10, 2014 to Jun 26, 2014"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.43,"scored_by":24054,"rank":7013,"popularity":2673,"members":62261,"favorites":77,"synopsis":"This world has gone through many Dusks, and is slowly nearing its end.

He was taken to an Este salon by a mysterious beautiful girl who appeared suddenly, to receive a free trial of beauty treatment as well as a massage. When Hiroshi returned home after a beauty treatment, he was surprised to see himself in the form of a robot. Shinnosuke gets overjoyed, whereas Misae gets worried on seeing him as a naked robot. The robot version of Hiroshi turns out to be convenient. The robot Hiroshi could be controlled by a remote control and pretty much do anything including cooking and cleaning. Meanwhile, Hiroshi realizes that his turning into a robot has to do something with that Este salon. However, this new change was a dark conspiracy hatched by “Chichi Yure Doumei (The Association of Fathers)” to create a strong father figure for all the fathers in Japan. Soon, many dads in the whole nation go out of control, and the Nohara family (Shinnosuke's family) and Kasukabe start falling apart. Before the near-collapse of Kasukabe, Shinnosuke and Hiroshi i.e. Robot dad stand up to save the day. Featuring the most intense battle of middle-aged men, the movie brings a touching story that makes all fathers and families in Japan cry.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":"Winner of the Excellence Award at the 18th Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1377,"type":"anime","name":"Futabasha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1377/Futabasha"},{"mal_id":2135,"type":"anime","name":"Imagine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":21737,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21737/Tamayura__More_Aggressive_-_Tsuitachi_dake_no_Shuugakuryokou_nanode","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/63207l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tamayura: More Aggressive -

Reserved college student Ken Kaneki buries his nose in books and avoids the news of the growing crisis.

Ostracized by her female classmates in middle school for being a little too popular with the boys, she desperately strives to avoid a similar situation in high school by being unnecessarily noisy and graceless.\n\nNevertheless, scattered among Futaba's unpleasant memories are the treasured moments with the boy she had a crush on, Kou Tanaka. Unfortunately, that spell abruptly ended on a sour note when he suddenly stopped attending school and never came back. When Futaba finds out that Kou has returned—with a different last name this time—she can already feel the butterflies in her stomach. However, Kou Mabuchi is not the warm boy that she remembers from her days in middle school; he is now taller, more charismatic and withdrawn—making him far less approachable.\n\nFutaba believes that if she returns to her former self, Kou will begin to take notice of her again. But is she prepared to sacrifice her bubble of normalcy and risk losing her friends in the process?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ao Haru Ride is the anime adaptation of the manga series written and illustrated by Io Sakisaka, which was serialized in the shoujo magazine Bessatsu Margaret between 2011 and 2015.

Deciding reluctantly to use this new gift to help the city, she becomes Tokyo's new hero, dubbed the \"White Girl.\" Along with Kyoutarou, who gained the power of teleportation, Rinka begins righting the wrongs in the city while fighting other espers who have much less noble intentions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":23421,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23421/Re_␣Hamatora","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75641l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"2wOG2K4CxsM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wOG2K4CxsM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wOG2K4CxsM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2wOG2K4CxsM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2wOG2K4CxsM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2wOG2K4CxsM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2wOG2K4CxsM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2wOG2K4CxsM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Re:␣Hamatora"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hamatora The Animation 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Reply Hamatora"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Re:␣ ハマトラ"},{"type":"English","title":"Re: Hamatora: Season 2"},{"type":"German","title":"Re: Hamatora: Staffel 2"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Re: Hamatora"},{"type":"French","title":"Hamatora The Animation Saison 2"}],"title":"Re:␣Hamatora","title_english":"Re: Hamatora: Season 2","title_japanese":"Re:␣ ハマトラ","title_synonyms":["Hamatora The Animation 2nd Season","Reply Hamatora"],"type":"TV","source":"Mixed media","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":7,"year":2014},"to":{"day":23,"month":9,"year":2014}},"string":"Jul 8, 2014 to Sep 23, 2014"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.35,"scored_by":77796,"rank":2408,"popularity":1347,"members":167356,"favorites":416,"synopsis":"It has been three months since the incident at Yokohama.

He is a pushover, unlucky, and fearful of many things. His personality makes him a failure in life, even affecting his progeny. This causes his great-great-grandchild, Sewashi, to take control of the situation.\n\nSewashi travels back in time from the 22nd century to the 20th century to meet Nobita, who is shocked to see him appear out of his drawer alongside a blue robotic cat. The robotic cat calls himself Doraemon, who claims to have been pressured by Sewashi to assist Nobita, with their ultimate goal being to provide Nobita happiness. Frustrated after seeing Nobita's hopeless state, Doraemon decides to go back to the future. However, Sewashi activates a program within Doraemon that prevents him from doing so. \n\nForced to stay, Doraemon helps Nobita using futuristic gadgets through his four-dimensional pocket—a bag containing anything inside it.

Resolving to defeat this phantom, Keisuke mobilizes the Akagi Red Suns to take on the local Akina Speed Stars racing team in an exchange race. He anticipates that the competition will lure the elusive \"Ghost of Akina\" out into the open and give him the opportunity to exact revenge for his previous defeat. \n\nWhile his friend Itsuki Takeuchi is obsessed with cars and racing, Takumi Fujiwara is not. He fails to understand the \"rush\" that racers experience and any talk of cars reminds him of the tofu deliveries he makes for his father in an old AE86. His early morning routine takes him up and down Mount Akina, where he has memorized every hairpin, brake point, and turn better than anyone else. \n\nWhen the Akagi team appears one night to challenge the Speed Stars to an exchange race, they accept the challenge only to find out that they are completely outclassed. The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team. With a bit of coercion, Takumi takes the wheel of the AE86 and heads off to Mount Akina to defend the pride of all racers in Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"New Initial D Movie: Legend 1 - Kakusei was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sentai Filmworks on December 5, 2017.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Ultra Super Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":537,"type":"anime","name":"SANZIGEN","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/537/SANZIGEN"},{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":22689,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/22689/Terra_Formars__Bugs_2-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1149/97842l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"2jf7OKHquHM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jf7OKHquHM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jf7OKHquHM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2jf7OKHquHM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2jf7OKHquHM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2jf7OKHquHM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2jf7OKHquHM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/2jf7OKHquHM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Terra Formars: Bugs 2-hen"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Terra Formars: Bugs2 2599"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"TERRAFORMARS OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"テラフォーマーズ　バグズ２号編"}],"title":"Terra Formars: Bugs 2-hen","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"テラフォーマーズ　バグズ２号編","title_synonyms":["Terra Formars: Bugs2 2599","TERRAFORMARS OVA"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":8,"year":2014},"to":{"day":19,"month":11,"year":2014}},"string":"Aug 19, 2014 to Nov 19, 2014"},"duration":"26 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.15,"scored_by":19789,"rank":3440,"popularity":3585,"members":36283,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"Adaptation of the Bugs 2 arc of the manga.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":415,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Bros.

The three fought the evil Tiger General, who had risen up against the kingdom's ruler. It was the former ruler's dying wish that Lala would replace him. Missing her friends, Yugo finds her way back to the fantastical kingdom where she finds a disheartened Uncle Bear. He is sad that Lala is leaving him to move into the palace. However, Lala is unsure if she is the right one to rule the kingdom. \n\nMeanwhile, a new sinister plot is developing. The kingdom's ancient behemoths have shrunken in size after their annual migration. While investigating, Yugo, Lala, and Uncle Bear are trapped in the underground kingdom of the rats where all the shrunken animals have ended up. With the help of an ingenious mole, they fight the rodent soldiers and escape. Yugo tracks down the very last behemoth in the kingdom and learns that the kingdom's water supply is being deliberately poisoned. When they learn that the only uncontaminated water left in the kingdom is under the control of the militaristic rats, Yugo and her furry friends must save the kingdom again.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":34711,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34711/Benpiyaku_Colace","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/83688l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Benpiyaku Colace"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"便秘薬　コーラック"}],"title":"Benpiyaku Colace","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"便秘薬　コーラック","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Original","episodes":7,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":31,"month":7,"year":2014},"to":{"day":4,"month":1,"year":2016}},"string":"Jul 31, 2014 to Jan 4, 2016"},"duration":"24 sec per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":15565,"popularity":19297,"members":211,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Taisho Pharmaceutical commissioned commercials for their new Benpiyaku Colace anti-constipation medicine.

They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins.

Seventeen years later, their pursuit is still growing in both size and brutality. Unbeknownst to the citizens, the targets of these witch hunts are the secret protectors of humanity.

Though he possesses great power, he struggles to overcome the hatred he bears from his mother's death at the hands of the kingdom. His father German, known as Zoro the Shadow Cutting Knight, is still training Leon when he is called to investigate the upsurge of Horrors in the kingdom's capital. Although German knows Leon's will is wavering, he decides to bring Leon along to continue his training.\n\nAs German and Leon head to the capital, the king's amiable son Alfonso San Valiante struggles to find a solution to the growing Horror threat. But before he can do so, he is double-crossed and banished from his own kingdom. To return home, Alfonso sets out to find the help and strength he needs to reclaim the throne.

Displeased by these recent changes, many former samurai plot against the new government, inciting a wave of bloodshed. To counter this movement, the government constructs a colossal prison in the middle of Lake Biwa. \n\nUnofficially assigned to help the police arrest criminals, Tenka Kumou also serves as a ferryman to the Lake Biwa prison with the help of his two younger siblings: the ambitious Soramaru and the enthusiastic Chuutarou. Together with the former Fuma ninja Shirasu Kinjou, the Kumou brothers live a frugal and joyful life mostly dedicated to studying and training.\n\nHowever, behind this relatively uneventful daily routine, the specter of the \"Orochi\" curse is starting to spread its shadow over the city of Oumi. According to legend, every three hundred years, Orochi reincarnates in a human vessel—and it is believed that this is the harbinger of an imminent catastrophe. As various groups clash in search of Orochi's vessel, some aim to seal the curse, while others have darker plans in motion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Donten ni Warau was released on Blu-ray and DVD as Laughing Under the Clouds by Funimation Entertainment on August 23, 2016.","season":"fall","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Doga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":27891,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/27891/Sword_Art_Online_II__Debriefing","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Sword Art Online II: Debriefing"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sword Art Online II Episode 14.5"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sword Art Online II Recap"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SAO 2 Recap"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ソードアート・オンライン II"},{"type":"English","title":"Sword Art Online II: Debriefing"},{"type":"German","title":"Sword Art Online Staffel 2"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Sword Art Online Temporada 2"},{"type":"French","title":"Sword Art Online Saison 2"}],"title":"Sword Art Online II: Debriefing","title_english":"Sword Art Online II: Debriefing","title_japanese":"ソードアート・オンライン II","title_synonyms":["Sword Art Online II Episode 14.5","Sword Art Online II Recap","SAO 2 Recap"],"type":"Special","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":10,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 11, 2014"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"PG-13 -

Although often backed into a corner by persistent police investigator Dokusaburou Oniyama, the self-proclaimed \"Miracle Maker\" uses his arsenal of flashy tricks to escape, straddling the line between science and magic. \n\nIn the middle of a heist to steal the \"Dragon Gem\" from the mansion of a haughty multimillionaire, Joker meets Hachi, a clumsy but earnest ninja. Hachi is after the same treasure but idolizes Joker, who in return merely sees him as a nuisance. Still, the two are able to work together to perform a successful heist. Seeing Hachi's wit and courage, as well as his convenient ability to perform housework, Joker reluctantly accepts him as a disciple.\n\nAs they set off with their eyes set on the next prize, Joker and Hachi butt heads with other phantom thieves. Facing both old friends and new foes alike, Joker competes to become the best \"magician\" of the shining night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":142,"type":"anime","name":"Asatsu DK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/142/Asatsu_DK"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":23249,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23249/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2199__Hoshimeguru_Hakobune","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/67623l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"em6JGGafOeg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em6JGGafOeg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/em6JGGafOeg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/em6JGGafOeg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/em6JGGafOeg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/em6JGGafOeg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/em6JGGafOeg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/em6JGGafOeg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199: Hoshimeguru Hakobune"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199: Hoshi-Meguru Hakobune"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Space Battleship Yamato 2199: Odyssey of the Celestial Ark"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"宇宙戦艦ヤマト2199 星巡る方舟"},{"type":"English","title":"Space Battleship Yamato 2199: Odyssey of the Celestial Ark"},{"type":"German","title":"Star Blazers 2199: Space Battle Ship Yamato, Odyssey of the Celestial Arc"}],"title":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199: Hoshimeguru Hakobune","title_english":"Space Battleship Yamato 2199: Odyssey of the Celestial Ark","title_japanese":"宇宙戦艦ヤマト2199 星巡る方舟","title_synonyms":["Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199: Hoshi-Meguru Hakobune","Space Battleship Yamato 2199: Odyssey of the Celestial Ark"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":12,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 6, 2014"},"duration":"1 hr 51 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.71,"scored_by":5386,"rank":1147,"popularity":5429,"members":13816,"favorites":16,"synopsis":"2199 AD. Yamato tried to leave behind the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy, after receiving a \"Cosmo Reverse System\" at its destination, Iscandar. However, suddenly, it encounters a mysterious group at the edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The crew finds out that the group is called the \"Gatlantis,\" and that its leader is the Gutaba expeditionary force commander who calls himself \"Goran Dagaamu of Thunder.\" The commander demands that Yamato be handed over to him. Yamato, wanting to hurry to Earth, escapes the fray. However, Yamato is attacked by a devastating beam weapon called the \"Flame Direct Attack Cannon\" that can transcend space.\n\nYamato was able to retreat, but ends up getting lost, and finds itself in a strangely colored irregular dimension. The crew decides to turn off the engine on the ship, and explore a mysterious planet. In order to collect information, Kodai, Kiryū, Sawamura, Niimi, and Aihara land on the planet. What they saw when they arrived was a ship that was not supposed to be there.\n\nDagaamu chases after the traces of Yamato's warp, and also reaches the strangely colored space. The planet on which Yamato landed was in fact what Dagaamu had been looking for all along.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":"Winner of the 46th Seiun Award (2015) for Best Dramatic Presentation.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":230,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"},{"mal_id":1097,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Games","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"},{"mal_id":1571,"type":"anime","name":"Voyager Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1571/Voyager_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":26359,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26359/Persona_4_the_Golden_Animation__Thank_you_Mr_Accomplice","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68381l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Persona 4 the Golden Animation: Thank you Mr. Accomplice"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Persona 4 The Golden Animation: Another End"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ペルソナ4 ザ・ゴールデンアニメーション Thank you Mr. Accomplice"}],"title":"Persona 4 the Golden Animation: Thank you Mr. Accomplice","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ペルソナ4 ザ・ゴールデンアニメーション Thank you Mr. Accomplice","title_synonyms":["Persona 4 The Golden Animation: Another End"],"type":"Special","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":12,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 10, 2014"},"duration":"16 min","rating":"PG-13 -

No matter what they do to themselves, the lust won’t go away. They discover that the cause of this is a virus, with the only cure for it being male sperm. Unfortunately, the cure is only temporary and if the lust continues uncontrolled, it results in the host of the virus dying from cardiac arrest.\n\nNow there is quite literally only one man who can save them all—the very same man that they shunned before being stuck on the island. The question of Jutaijima is not whether he will or won’t save them, but what sexual measures he will go to in order to do so?","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":823,"type":"anime","name":"Lune Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/823/Lune_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":405,"type":"anime","name":"T-Rex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/405/T-Rex"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":28431,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/28431/Pokemon_Omega_Ruby___Alpha_Sapphire__Mega_Special_Animation","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/70071l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire: Mega Special Animation"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ポケットモンスター オメガルビー・アルファサファイア』 メガスペシャルアニメーション"}],"title":"Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire: Mega Special Animation","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ポケットモンスター オメガルビー・アルファサファイア』 メガスペシャルアニメーション","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":16,"month":11,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 16, 2014"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"PG - Children","score":6.74,"scored_by":5072,"rank":5329,"popularity":6177,"members":10064,"favorites":4,"synopsis":"The Pokemon Company streamed the \"Mega Special Animation\" short inspired by the upcoming Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire games on Sunday.

He is older and perhaps a bit wiser. He’s now a respected detective and is recognized by the name of Bobby Mak instead of his baby name McDull. When he is called in to solve a death, his quick powers of observation save the day. If his deduction is true, no homicide took place. Everyone at the mansion is required to wait, and when the kids arrive, somebody has to entertain them. Mak recounts his life to them and he particularly emphasizes the closeness he had with his mother. From his days as a kid to his formative young adult years, she’s protected, given her sage advice and raised him like any mother would. She even tried to be a superhero, but an astronaut she is not. The metaphors are obvious, because the hospital she goes for that “space training” means she is ill. To a very young mind, to process certain situations can be tough.\n\nThe universal messages are understood. The Mak family was never rich. To see the two struggle through young McDull’s eyes is enduring and Chinese youths born outside of this country can get an understanding where their parents came from. \n\n(Source: Ed Sum from The Vintage Tempest)","background":"The film won Best Animation Feature at the 52nd Golden Horse Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":32857,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32857/Natsu_no_Ginkei","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78767l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Natsu no Ginkei"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Natsuno Ginkei"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"夏の銀景"}],"title":"Natsu no Ginkei","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"夏の銀景","title_synonyms":["Natsuno Ginkei"],"type":"Music","source":"Music","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":10,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 9, 2014"},"duration":"6 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.22,"scored_by":114,"rank":null,"popularity":18742,"members":242,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A music video for the Aobouzu song \"Natsu no Ginkei\".","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1390,"type":"anime","name":"Toy's Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1390/Toys_Factory"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":39947,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39947/September","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/101476l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"September"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"September"}],"title":"September","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"September","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Music","source":"Music","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":11,"year":2014},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 17, 2014"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.95,"scored_by":118,"rank":null,"popularity":18798,"members":239,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Music video directed by Kouhei Yoshino for the Japanese pop cover of Earth, Wind &amp;
