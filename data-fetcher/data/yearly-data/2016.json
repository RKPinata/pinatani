After his duel with Lisesharte, Lux ends up attending the female-only academy that trains royals to be Drag-Knights.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":"Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut is the fourth project created to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the GA Bunko imprint, the production company responsible for launching the original source material.","season":"winter","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":1109,"type":"anime","name":"Orange","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1109/Orange"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":456,"type":"anime","name":"Lerche","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/456/Lerche"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":27833,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/27833/Durararax2_Ketsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"S6WCHOxTfBM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6WCHOxTfBM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6WCHOxTfBM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"デュラララ!!×2 結"},{"type":"English","title":"Durarara!! x2 Ketsu"}],"title":"Durarara!!x2 Ketsu","title_english":"Durarara!! x2 Ketsu","title_japanese":"デュラララ!!×2 結","title_synonyms":["Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":1,"year":2016},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":2016}},"string":"Jan 9, 2016 to Mar 26, 2016"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.06,"scored_by":183882,"rank":534,"popularity":602,"members":372728,"favorites":1084,"synopsis":"As Mikado Ryuugamine continues to purge the Dollars from within in accordance with his warped sense of justice, Masaomi Kida hopes to bring his friend back to his senses by bringing the Yellow Scarves together once more.

The two become fast friends along with Uzal's pet cyborg Clarion, a cat-like combat android. Soon after parting ways, a terrorist attack on the island threatens to shatter the pair's new friendship. In a bid to save her new friend, Uzal gives Nene the ability to use the Pandora Device found in Clarion's body before seemingly dying. With this power, Nene can temporarily master abilities and skills never seen before in the advancing world.\n\nWorking together, the two unlikely companions go on various missions—from saving children in shopping mall fires to fighting reckless thieves—all in the name of world peace.

And to make matters worse, Nene's guardian, as well as genius inventor, Takumi Korobase has an undying interest in B.U.E.R.\n\nBurdened with saving the world and keeping B.U.E.R from the hands of evil, Nene and Clarion's desire for world peace seems like a pipe dream. With this monumental goal, could the weight of it all destroy the pair's friendship completely? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":418,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Gokumi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"},{"mal_id":1299,"type":"anime","name":"AXsiZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1299/AXsiZ"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":31994,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31994/Yami_Shibai_3","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"JZfHLuUXvv4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZfHLuUXvv4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZfHLuUXvv4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZfHLuUXvv4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZfHLuUXvv4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZfHLuUXvv4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZfHLuUXvv4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZfHLuUXvv4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yami Shibai 3"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories Third Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Theater of Darkness 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Japanese Ghost Stories 3"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"闇芝居 3期"},{"type":"English","title":"Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 3"},{"type":"German","title":"Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 3"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Yamishibai: Historias Japonesas de Fantasmas Temporada 3"},{"type":"French","title":"Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 3"}],"title":"Yami Shibai 3","title_english":"Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 3","title_japanese":"闇芝居 3期","title_synonyms":["Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories Third Season","Theater of Darkness 3rd Season","Japanese Ghost Stories 3"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":1,"year":2016},"to":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2016}},"string":"Jan 11, 2016 to Apr 4, 2016"},"duration":"4 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.33,"scored_by":20443,"rank":7539,"popularity":3537,"members":37216,"favorites":43,"synopsis":"A young boy silently sketches out the forms of the horrors that dwell in his mind.

This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.\n\nSince he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!\n\nEnduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mangaka Horikoushi Kouhei has noted that American superhero comics are the inspiration for the series, and has based character pages on logos for Marvel and DC comic characters.","season":"spring","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"17:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 17:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":31240,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"vFfXjuVA1Jk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFfXjuVA1Jk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFfXjuVA1Jk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFfXjuVA1Jk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFfXjuVA1Jk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFfXjuVA1Jk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFfXjuVA1Jk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFfXjuVA1Jk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Re: Life in a different world from zero"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Re:Zero"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"ReZero"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Re：ゼロから始める異世界生活"},{"type":"English","title":"Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-"},{"type":"German","title":"Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Re:Zero -Empezar de cero en un mundo diferente-"},{"type":"French","title":"Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World-"}],"title":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu","title_english":"Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-","title_japanese":"Re：ゼロから始める異世界生活","title_synonyms":["Re: Life in a different world from zero","Re:Zero","ReZero"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":25,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2016},"to":{"day":19,"month":9,"year":2016}},"string":"Apr 4, 2016 to Sep 19, 2016"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.23,"scored_by":1375838,"rank":318,"popularity":25,"members":2137221,"favorites":66038,"synopsis":"When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world.

Unfortunately, the only way to save the Earth is by having three people with extraordinary potential demonstrate a new skill on a crane game, which will create a beam of energy able to divert the asteroids.\n\nThe only three people with enough potential are three high school girls—Asuka, Mirai, and Kyouko. In order to harness their energy, Saya tells them that she has scouted them as idols and has them work at an arcade where she can monitor them. She says to the girls that all successful idols are good at crane games, and that building their skills is their first step in idol training. As the girls learn new crane game techniques, they begin to doubt Saya's intentions but are nonetheless unaware that the fate of the Earth lies in their hands.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":833,"type":"anime","name":"Kyotoma","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/833/Kyotoma"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"},{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":36241,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36241/One_Piece_Film__Gold_-_Cine_Mike_Popcorn_Kokuchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/87542l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece Film: Gold -

They are interspersed with advertisements for a cure-all \"Law-Evading Rock,\" depicted as a rainbow-colored disk. Datsu, who is entranced by the stream of clips, blindly follows the advertisements. Near the end of the song, Datsu is tapped on the shoulder by the male group featured on TV. The leader inserts a \"Law-Evading Rock\" disk into Datsu's back.

It looks like his new school life is going to be full of embarrassment.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1604,"type":"anime","name":"Sun TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1604/Sun_TV"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1053,"type":"anime","name":"Production IMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1053/Production_IMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":29758,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/29758/Taboo_Tattoo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80197l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"gYwKZHDVW4Q","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYwKZHDVW4Q","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYwKZHDVW4Q?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gYwKZHDVW4Q/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gYwKZHDVW4Q/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gYwKZHDVW4Q/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gYwKZHDVW4Q/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gYwKZHDVW4Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Taboo Tattoo"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"タブー・タトゥー"},{"type":"English","title":"Taboo Tattoo"}],"title":"Taboo Tattoo","title_english":"Taboo Tattoo","title_japanese":"タブー・タトゥー","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2016},"to":{"day":20,"month":9,"year":2016}},"string":"Jul 5, 2016 to Sep 20, 2016"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":5.74,"scored_by":124612,"rank":10443,"popularity":824,"members":282986,"favorites":240,"synopsis":"Seigi, a martial arts trained middle schooler, often feels driven to protect the weaker people around him.

To protect the future of the country, all of Japan's children are cryogenically frozen until the end of the war to keep them out of harm's way.\n\nSeveral years pass, and humanity has established a foothold in a corner of Japan, which now serves as the frontline of the war. No longer facing humanity's extinction, the children are awakened from their slumber. It is then discovered that, while in cryogenesis, the children had developed Worlds, supernatural powers unique to each person. The six most powerful children are given command of the reclaimed cities, using their powers to defend the strongholds against the continuing invasion. Childhood friends Ichiya Suzaku and Canaria Utara lead Tokyo, siblings Kasumi and Asuha Chigusa manage Chiba, and Maihime Tenkawa and Hotaru Rindou oversee Kanagawa.\n\nOver time, the almost routine attacks from the Unknown and the clashing personalities of the city heads and subheads cultivate petty rivalries, leading to constant arguments between the three cities. With the Unknown suddenly increasing the pressure of their attacks, the three cities' leaders must learn how to work together or risk losing the last line of defense against humanity's extinction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Qualidea Code is part of an overall multimedia project by five publishers: Shueisha's Dash X Bunko imprint, Kadokawa's Fujimi Fantasia Bunko imprint, Kadokawa's MF Bunko J imprint, Shogakukan's Gagaga Bunko imprint, and Shueisha's Jump SQ magazine.

He remembers the 1896 and 1933 Sanriku earthquakes and tsunamis in proposing the project. The 15.5-meter (51-foot) floodgate — the highest in the Tohoku region — ends up sparing Fudai the damage that the 2011 tsunami subjected other coastal towns. \n\n\"Manabu\" centers on elementary school children in Kamaishi City during the 2011 disaster, illustrating their lessons learned in disaster readiness to head to higher ground. The story will show \"Tsunami Tendenko,\" a local custom telling people to individually seek higher ground on their own initiative, in a lesson that the children would teach their parents. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":"The anime will be shown for free during the Japan Society of Civil Engineers' National Convention in Sendai on September 7 and September 9.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"Educational","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/56/Educational"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":34600,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34600/Nagoya_Tetsudou_Special_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/83456l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nagoya Tetsudou Special Movie"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nagoya Railway Special Movie"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"名古屋鉄道スペシャルムービー"}],"title":"Nagoya Tetsudou Special Movie","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"名古屋鉄道スペシャルムービー","title_synonyms":["Nagoya Railway Special Movie"],"type":"ONA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":7,"year":2016},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 21, 2016"},"duration":"2 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.81,"scored_by":108,"rank":10124,"popularity":17449,"members":325,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"A short commissioned by Nagoya Railroad Co., Ltd.

They interrogate her, but her wiles, skills, and charms allow her to easily escape from their grasp, setting off a chain of events that will lead to the true purpose of the Sushi Police being revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":51658,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51658/You_Yao_Qi_Guanggao_Pian__Gao_Neng_Qi_Chuang_Zhuang_Tai_Jia","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1144/123062l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"You Yao Qi Guanggao Pian: Gao Neng Qi Chuang Zhuang Tai Jia"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiaohua: Mizone CM"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"有妖气广告篇　高能起床状态佳"}],"title":"You Yao Qi Guanggao Pian: Gao Neng Qi Chuang Zhuang Tai Jia","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"有妖气广告篇　高能起床状态佳","title_synonyms":["Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiaohua: Mizone CM"],"type":"Special","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":2016},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 26, 2016"},"duration":"35 sec","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":14786,"popularity":20982,"members":114,"favorites":0,"synopsis":null,"background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":51248,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51248/Saseum_Kkoch","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/121435l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Saseum Kkoch"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"사슴꽃"},{"type":"English","title":"Deer Flower"}],"title":"Saseum Kkoch","title_english":"Deer Flower","title_japanese":"사슴꽃","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":18,"month":8,"year":2016},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 18, 2016"},"duration":"7 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":20122,"popularity":21189,"members":105,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A boy and his family visit deer farm.

At age 23, Yuuri's window for success in skating is closing rapidly, and his love of pork cutlets and aptitude for gaining weight are not helping either.\n\nHowever, Yuuri finds himself in the spotlight when a video of him performing a routine previously executed by five-time world champion, Victor Nikiforov, suddenly goes viral. In fact, Victor himself abruptly appears at Yuuri's house and offers to be his mentor. As one of his biggest fans, Yuuri eagerly accepts, kicking off his journey to make it back onto the world stage. But the competition is fierce, as the rising star from Russia, Yuri Plisetsky, is relentlessly determined to defeat Yuuri and win back Victor's tutelage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Yuri!!! on Ice won the Animation of the Year award in the Television category at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival in 2017.","season":"fall","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"02:21","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 02:21 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1586,"type":"anime","name":"CIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1586/CIC"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":70,"type":"anime","name":"Performing Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":32867,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32867/Bungou_Stray_Dogs_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1572/133096l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"A70E8AXQhjg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A70E8AXQhjg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A70E8AXQhjg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/A70E8AXQhjg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/A70E8AXQhjg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/A70E8AXQhjg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/A70E8AXQhjg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/A70E8AXQhjg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bungou Stray Dogs 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"文豪ストレイドッグス"},{"type":"English","title":"Bungo Stray Dogs 2"},{"type":"German","title":"Bungo Stray Dogs Staffel 2"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Bungo Stray Dogs 2"},{"type":"French","title":"Bungo Stray Dogs Saison 2"}],"title":"Bungou Stray Dogs 2nd Season","title_english":"Bungo Stray Dogs 2","title_japanese":"文豪ストレイドッグス","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":2016},"to":{"day":16,"month":12,"year":2016}},"string":"Oct 6, 2016 to Dec 16, 2016"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.19,"scored_by":479660,"rank":370,"popularity":207,"members":829464,"favorites":6726,"synopsis":"Despite their differences in position, three men—the youngest senior executive of the Port Mafia, Osamu Dazai; the lowest ranking member, Sakunosuke Oda; and the intelligence agent, Ango Sakaguchi—gather at the Lupin Bar at the end of the day to relax and take delight in the company of friends.\n\nHowever, one night, Ango disappears.

Serinuma can't help but to fantasize about her male classmates falling for each other and enjoys imagining them together. A more known fact about Serinuma, however, is that she’s noticeably overweight. \n\nWhile watching her favorite show one day, Serinuma witnesses the death of her most beloved character. Utterly depressed, she can't muster up the energy to eat her meals, let alone attend school. After an entire week, she finally recovers.

The rules are simple: one player has to carry the ball past the goalposts across the field while avoiding the other team, who are allowed to use all their force to knock the enemy down. However, the player can pass to a teammate behind them or kick the ball before they are tackled. Unlike other sports, the game continues even when the person holding the ball is taken down.\n\nKenji Gion is a short but feisty high school freshman at Kanagawa High School. Right after the school's opening ceremony, he meets the tall and timid Sumiaki Iwashimizu, and the two of them get an invitation to observe the rugby club. \n\nWhen Gion watches the match, he realizes that even though big and tall guys have an advantage, there are positions for people of all shapes and sizes.

Eager to explore the island, Satoshi and Pikachu run wild with excitement, quickly losing their way while chasing after a Pokémon. The pair eventually stumbles upon the Pokémon School, an institution where students come to learn more about these fascinating creatures.\n\nAt the school, when he and one of the students—the no-nonsense Kaki—have a run-in with the nefarious thugs of Team Skull, Satoshi discovers the overwhelming might of the Z-Moves, powerful attacks originating from the Alola region that require the trainer and Pokémon to be in sync. Later that night, he and Pikachu have an encounter with the guardian deity Pokémon of Melemele Island, the mysterious Kapu Kokeko. The Pokémon of legend bestows upon them a Z-Ring, a necessary tool in using the Z-Moves. Dazzled by their earlier battle and now in possession of a Z-Ring, Satoshi and Pikachu decide to stay behind in the Alola Region to learn and master the strength of these powerful new attacks.\n\nEnrolling in the Pokémon School, Satoshi is joined by classmates such as Lillie, who loves Pokémon but cannot bring herself to touch them, Kaki, and many others. Between attending classes, fending off the pesky Team Rocket—who themselves have arrived in Alola to pave the way for their organization's future plans—and taking on the Island Challenge that is necessary to master the Z-Moves, Satoshi and Pikachu are in for an exciting new adventure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The airing time was Thursdays at 18:55 between November 17, 2016 - September 13, 2018.

This is the story of Closers in New Seoul.\nMysterious dimensional gates opened all over the planet and unleashed a worldwide invasion of dimensional monsters. No monsters and tactics had any effect on the waves of dimensional monsters pouring out of the dimensional gates. City after city was mercilessly destroyed.\n\nBut the opening of the dimensional gates did not only cause damage and destruction. The psychokinetic power that it awoke also enabled a tiny minority of humans to gain extraordinary psychic powers. With these psychic warriors, governments around the world were able to turn the tide of the war with these monsters. After unspeakable losses, the people of earth at least succeeded in closing the gates. Since they had closed the gates, these psychics began to be called \"CLOSERS,\" and the invasion of the dimensional monsters was named the First Dimensional War.\n\nWith the dimensional monsters vanquished, peace returned to the world, and the cities were rebuilt. Through dedicated research into the dimensional gates and psychokinetic power, humans learned that the gates open when there is a singularity in this mysterious power. However, their understanding of the gates was still incomplete. The CLOSERS who survived the First Dimensional War became part of an organization called UNION. Together, they researched the psychokinetic power in all over the world, working to prevent another dimensional war.\n\nAnd that's when the dimensional gates all over the world started shaking again - as ever stronger outbreed creatures renewed the attack on earth.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":999,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Animal","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/999/Studio_Animal"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33994,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33994/Servamp_Specials","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83960l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Servamp Specials"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"SERVAMP-サーヴァンプ- オリジナルビデオアニメーション「Sleepy Life of SERVAMP」"}],"title":"Servamp Specials","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"SERVAMP-サーヴァンプ- オリジナルビデオアニメーション「Sleepy Life of SERVAMP」","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"Manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":11,"year":2016},"to":{"day":24,"month":2,"year":2017}},"string":"Nov 25, 2016 to Feb 24, 2017"},"duration":"5 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.91,"scored_by":4104,"rank":4523,"popularity":4848,"members":18757,"favorites":22,"synopsis":"Sleepy Life of SERVAMP\nWhen they are not busy battling supernatural threats, servamps and their Eves enjoy carefree day-to-day affairs and lighthearted quarrels.

She is greeted as \"Alice\" by twins known as Light and Shadow, who express their relief at Alice's return home. Arisa is insistent that she is not the Alice they speak of, but the strange characters of this world are adamant that she is.\n\nUpon meeting the kind and mysterious Black Rabbit, she learns that she is trapped in a place called Wonderland with no apparent escape. As she adjusts to her new reality, Arisa comes to find a whole host of peculiar creatures, such as the affectionate Cheshire Cat and the lazy dormouse Round.\n\nBut there is more to Wonderland than meets the eye. Each of the wild personalities she now shares a home with resembles someone she knew in her other life, yet not a single one of them recognizes their old name or relationships.

It also allows users to win prizes, be ranked against others, play minigames (in the app), collect trophies, and find fellow pachinko friends.\n\nMidori-chan has also gone on to have her own digital 4-koma manga (2 different ones), LINE stickers, a book, and apparel line.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":38905,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38905/Xmas_Song","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1508/97879l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Xmas Song"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Xmas Song"},{"type":"English","title":"Xmas Song"}],"title":"Xmas Song","title_english":"Xmas Song","title_japanese":"Xmas Song","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Music","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":12,"year":2016},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 9, 2016"},"duration":"2 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.41,"scored_by":225,"rank":null,"popularity":16956,"members":363,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Music video by Kousuke Sugimoto for Xmas Song by the band VIVA SHERRY in their Christmas album \"Xmas Songs.\"","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":34416,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34416/The_Snack_World__Hitogirai_no_Renny","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/107815l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"The Snack World: Hitogirai no Renny"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Snack World Short Movie 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"The SNACK WORLD 人嫌いのレニー"},{"type":"English","title":"Snack World: Lenny the Misanthrope"}],"title":"The Snack World: Hitogirai no Renny","title_english":"Snack World: Lenny the Misanthrope","title_japanese":"The SNACK WORLD 人嫌いのレニー","title_synonyms":["The Snack World Short Movie 2"],"type":"Movie","source":"Mixed media","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2016-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":12,"year":2016},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 17, 2016"},"duration":"10 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":13595,"popularity":17114,"members":351,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"The Snack World follows a ragtag group of friends who embark on an adventure together.
