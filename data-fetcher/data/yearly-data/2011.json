Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, being transgender, relationships, and acceptance.\n\nLauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's Hourou Musuko is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices.","background":"Please note that this series was 11 episodes when aired on TV but 12 episodes when it was released on BD & DVD.

However, it does not take long for her dreams of monopolizing her brother to be put in jeopardy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"anime","name":"Starchild Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":218,"type":"anime","name":"Zexcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8857,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8857/Nichijou__Nichijou_no_0-wa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/25521l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"CD6VdVDVDXI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD6VdVDVDXI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CD6VdVDVDXI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CD6VdVDVDXI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CD6VdVDVDXI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CD6VdVDVDXI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CD6VdVDVDXI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CD6VdVDVDXI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nichijou: Nichijou no 0-wa"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nichijou Episode 0"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Nichijou OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Everyday"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"日常の０話"},{"type":"English","title":"My Ordinary Life Episode 0"}],"title":"Nichijou: Nichijou no 0-wa","title_english":"My Ordinary Life Episode 0","title_japanese":"日常の０話","title_synonyms":["Nichijou Episode 0","Nichijou OVA","Everyday"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":3,"year":2011},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 12, 2011"},"duration":"22 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.4,"scored_by":44901,"rank":2163,"popularity":2231,"members":84021,"favorites":55,"synopsis":"While the title suggests a story of simple, everyday school life, the contents are more the opposite.

Players of the popular game are called \"cardfighters,\" and they frequently battle each other in card shops. The game has inspired many people, one of which is the quiet and timid Aichi Sendou who is often ridiculed and bullied by his peers. Whenever he feels down, he takes a glance at Blaster Blade—a legendary rare card given to him when he was young—and gains the motivation to move on with his life. \n\nHowever, one day, school bully Katsumi Morikawa notices Aichi's treasure and snatches the card away from him. After a turn of events, Aichi soon discovers that the card is now in the hands of Toshiki Kai, a cardfighter who has become the strongest in town despite having only recently arrived. To make matters worse, Kai refuses to return the card unless Aichi defeats him in a cardfight. \n\nMuch to everyone's surprise, Aichi rises up to the occasion. As he musters up his courage and pictures himself winning this decisive battle, Aichi begins to find his way into the adventurous world of Cardfight Vanguard. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Cardfight!!

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose.

Now with the two reunited after several years of separation, the reestablishment of their relationship is marked by Takano's vow to make Ritsu say that he loves him again.\n\nSekaiichi Hatsukoi follows three couples that are interconnected within the manga industry, with each being subject to the budding of first love. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9760,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9760/Hoshi_wo_Ou_Kodomo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1000/133740l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"T37GhIqsO28","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T37GhIqsO28","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T37GhIqsO28?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/T37GhIqsO28/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/T37GhIqsO28/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/T37GhIqsO28/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/T37GhIqsO28/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/T37GhIqsO28/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Children who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Journey to Agartha"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"星を追う子ども"},{"type":"English","title":"Children Who Chase Lost Voices"},{"type":"German","title":"Children Who Chase Lost Voices"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Viaje a Agartha"},{"type":"French","title":"Children Who Chase Lost Voices"}],"title":"Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo","title_english":"Children Who Chase Lost Voices","title_japanese":"星を追う子ども","title_synonyms":["Children who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below","Journey to Agartha"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":5,"year":2011},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 7, 2011"},"duration":"1 hr 56 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.52,"scored_by":95883,"rank":1734,"popularity":1101,"members":211078,"favorites":665,"synopsis":"If you could turn all your memories into a song, what would it resemble?\n\nBetween being an exceptional student and taking care of the house alone during her mother's absence, Asuna Watase's only distraction is listening to her old crystal radio in her secret mountain hideout.

It all leads to a chance encounter with a spirited young girl named Ui, who Kazuma ends up accidentally falling onto and kissing while she tries leading him back to the bus stop. This hardly sits well with Ui’s friend Ibuki who swiftly kicks Kazuma and sends him on his way.

Descend into an unreality filled with pratfalls, lewd behavior, and enough obscure cultural jetsam to drown us all!\n\n(Source: NIS America)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":921,"type":"anime","name":"Dynamic Planning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/921/Dynamic_Planning"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":10683,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10683/Tentacle_and_Witches","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1937/116455l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tentacle and Witches"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"テンタクル アンド ウィッチーズ"}],"title":"Tentacle and Witches","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"テンタクル アンド ウィッチーズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Visual novel","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2012-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":5,"year":2011},"to":{"day":30,"month":11,"year":2012}},"string":"May 27, 2011 to Nov 30, 2012"},"duration":"27 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":7.06,"scored_by":7510,"rank":null,"popularity":4930,"members":17919,"favorites":148,"synopsis":"High school can be a complicated time for young men, especially for young men named Ichirou Tachibana.

When fellow classmate and witch Lily Ramses Futaba catches him peaking on Yuuko, she decides it's the perfect time for her to use a new spell she's acquired and turn Ichirou into her familiar servant.\n\nLily's planned antagonism for Ichirou goes awry when the spell turns him into some sort of twisted, purple, tentacle monster. Now he must directly acquire sexual energy from witches in order to sate the tentacle monster's lust and retain elements of his humanity. To make matters worse for the two witches, Ichirou's new form gives him the power to control them to satisfy his basest desires!\n\nThe trio also find out that the spell that Lily acquired was sold to her deceptively and intentionally made to appear genuine. Amidst all the sexual misadventures in the Witches and Tentacle, they're about to discover that something far more sinister is at work, and they are but pawns within a larger game.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":195,"type":"anime","name":"Pixy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/195/Pixy"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":395,"type":"anime","name":"Oz Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/395/Oz_Inc"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9793,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9793/Senjou_no_Valkyria_3__Tagatame_no_Juusou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/27146l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Senjou no Valkyria 3: Tagatame no Juusou"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Valkyria Chronicles: Unrecorded Chronicles OVA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"戦場のヴァルキュリア3 誰がための銃瘡"}],"title":"Senjou no Valkyria 3: Tagatame no Juusou","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"戦場のヴァルキュリア3 誰がための銃瘡","title_synonyms":["Valkyria Chronicles: Unrecorded Chronicles OVA"],"type":"OVA","source":"Game","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":4,"year":2011},"to":{"day":29,"month":6,"year":2011}},"string":"Apr 13, 2011 to Jun 29, 2011"},"duration":"33 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.27,"scored_by":6219,"rank":2804,"popularity":5239,"members":15211,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"The Second Europa War is being fought between Gallia and the East Europan Imperial Alliance, and a penal military unit known as the Nameless is on the run from both superpowers.

In regards to the maiden, there must be an important man participating in the gang rape, in other words, that man must be related in blood to their wife or lover, mother or daughter, younger sister or older sister, and the like, and after the gang rape, if a pregnancy occurs, Hime Iwanaga's anger is abated, and a good harvest and safety upon the region will be promised.

For example, the \"Fukuoka-ken\" (Fukuoka dog),—Fukuoka of course being home to asianbeat HQ—uses the delicacy \"mentaiko\" (spicy pollack roe) as the motif for its canine characterization.\n\nEach of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, \"Fukuoka-ken\" being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi.\n\nAnother feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc.\n\n(Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1290,"type":"anime","name":"Pollyanna Graphics","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1290/Pollyanna_Graphics"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":11789,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11789/Wish_Me_Mell","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Wish Me Mell"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Wish Me Mell: Miracle Circus"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Wish Me Mell: Maimai no Humming Concert"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Wish me mell"}],"title":"Wish Me Mell","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"Wish me mell","title_synonyms":["Wish Me Mell: Miracle Circus","Wish Me Mell: Maimai no Humming Concert"],"type":"ONA","source":"Other","episodes":3,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2012-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":6,"year":2011},"to":{"day":20,"month":7,"year":2012}},"string":"Jun 5, 2011 to Jul 20, 2012"},"duration":"1 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.39,"scored_by":236,"rank":11685,"popularity":14948,"members":562,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"The characters in Sanrio's \"Wish me mell\" line star in three short specials.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":150,"type":"anime","name":"Sanrio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/150/Sanrio"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":10797,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10797/Kayoe_Chuugaku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1305/96062l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kayoe!

While crying out in desperation, Hotaru is approached by Gin—a mysterious boy wearing a mask—who offers to help her.\n\nOverjoyed at the sight of another person, Hotaru runs to Gin with open arms only to be rudely fended off. However, she quickly learns the grave reason behind his behavior: a dreadful curse has been cast upon Gin. Should he ever be touched by a human being, he will disappear forever.\n\nThough Gin urges her to never return, Hotaru does the exact opposite, and before too long, the two become close friends despite his delicate situation. Nonetheless, as years pass and their mutual feelings grow stronger, Hotaru and Gin start struggling with the boundaries that destiny has set between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hotarubi no Mori e premiered in Japanese cinemas on September 17, 2011.

Daikichi, angered by their coldness toward Rin, announces that he will take her in—despite the fact that he is a young, single man with no prior childcare experience.\n\nUsagi Drop is the story of Daikichi's journey through fatherhood as he raises Rin with his gentle and affectionate nature, as well as an exploration of the warmth and interdependence that are at the heart of a happy, close-knit family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/765/Sakura_Create"},{"mal_id":769,"type":"anime","name":"Fujipacific Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/769/Fujipacific_Music"},{"mal_id":1765,"type":"anime","name":"Shodensha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1765/Shodensha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]},{"mal_id":10110,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10110/Mayo_Chiki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/29971l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"WjHvETCh4Mw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjHvETCh4Mw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WjHvETCh4Mw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WjHvETCh4Mw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WjHvETCh4Mw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WjHvETCh4Mw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WjHvETCh4Mw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WjHvETCh4Mw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mayo Chiki!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"まよチキ!"},{"type":"English","title":"Mayo Chiki!"}],"title":"Mayo Chiki!","title_english":"Mayo Chiki!","title_japanese":"まよチキ!","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":7,"year":2011},"to":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":2011}},"string":"Jul 8, 2011 to Sep 30, 2011"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.23,"scored_by":263581,"rank":3005,"popularity":442,"members":486644,"favorites":1877,"synopsis":"Due to his mother and sister, who both love professional wrestling, Kinjirou Sakamachi developed a resilient body that could take hard punches, aggressive kicks, and even deadly vehicle bumps, in order to survive their various grappling positions and locks.

One evening before the start of the tournament, some of the players are attacked by a group of thugs, leaving them hospitalized with injuries. The only evidence distinguishing the assailants is a silver ring that each member wears on their hand and that their leader's name is Keith.\n\nIn an effort to stop the gang, the middle school students convene to discuss their options but are interrupted by Ling Xiu, the person who saved Ryouma the night before. Xiu identifies himself as a former member of Clack—a band of tennis players banned from official competition due to their violent playstyles and conduct. The students are warned to stay out of the affairs of Clack as they cannot hope to win against their tennis style.\n\nFrustrated by the situation, Ryouma sneaks out with Xiu to confront Keith and the other members of Clack with the intent to take them down single-handedly. Knowing Xiu's true objective, Ryouma is now more determined than ever to defeat Keith to save the latter from himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tennis no Oujisama Movie 2: Eikokushiki Teikyuu Shiro Kessen! was released in celebration of the Tennis no Oujisama anime adaptation's 10th anniversary.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":463,"type":"anime","name":"M.S.C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/463/MSC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":10573,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10573/Tennis_no_Oujisama__Another_Story_II_-_Ano_Toki_no_Bokura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/29026l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tennis no Oujisama: Another Story II - Ano Toki no Bokura"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tennis no Ouji-sama OVA Another Story II: Ano Toki no Bokura"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"テニスの王子様 OVA ANOTHER STORYⅡ～アノトキノボクラ"},{"type":"English","title":"The Prince of Tennis OVA Another Story II"}],"title":"Tennis no Oujisama: Another Story II - Ano Toki no Bokura","title_english":"The Prince of Tennis OVA Another Story II","title_japanese":"テニスの王子様 OVA ANOTHER STORYⅡ～アノトキノボクラ","title_synonyms":["Tennis no Ouji-sama OVA Another Story II: Ano Toki no Bokura"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":8,"year":2011},"to":{"day":26,"month":10,"year":2011}},"string":"Aug 26, 2011 to Oct 26, 2011"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.46,"scored_by":4502,"rank":1920,"popularity":6009,"members":10791,"favorites":7,"synopsis":"Tanjou!

Despite having no friends at school, Yukiteru is frequently seen talking to his supposedly imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space; and Deus' servant, Mur Mur.\n\nOne day, Yukiteru wakes up and discovers that certain events of his day are preemptively displayed on his cellphone. While initially dismissing it as a coincidence, he slowly realizes that the incidents written in his phone actually take place in the near future. After spending the day benefiting from this new asset, Yukiteru learns that his classmate Yuno Gasai possesses a similar diary.\n\nAs the two team up to defeat an odd pursuer and head back to their respective homes, Deus Ex Machina explains that they—alongside 10 other contestants—have been drawn into a survival game whose victor will become the deity's successor. With no other options, Yukiteru and Yuno must use their cellphones—now called \"Future Diaries\"—to survive this unforgiving battle royale.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mirai Nikki also spawned a live-action television show with a different plot from the manga and anime, as well as a visual novel.","season":"fall","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"},{"mal_id":352,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Pictures Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/352/Kadokawa_Pictures_Japan"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":665,"type":"anime","name":"chara-ani.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/665/chara-anicom"},{"mal_id":713,"type":"anime","name":"12 Diary Holders","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/713/12_Diary_Holders"},{"mal_id":715,"type":"anime","name":"Dwango","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/715/Dwango"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/765/Sakura_Create"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":163,"type":"anime","name":"asread.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/163/asread"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":59,"type":"anime","name":"High Stakes Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/59/High_Stakes_Game"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":10087,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1887/117644l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"21-1-ioCfXY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21-1-ioCfXY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/21-1-ioCfXY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/21-1-ioCfXY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/21-1-ioCfXY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/21-1-ioCfXY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/21-1-ioCfXY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/21-1-ioCfXY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Fate/Zero"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"フェイト/ゼロ"},{"type":"English","title":"Fate/Zero"}],"title":"Fate/Zero","title_english":"Fate/Zero","title_japanese":"フェイト/ゼロ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2011-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":10,"year":2011},"to":{"day":25,"month":12,"year":2011}},"string":"Oct 2, 2011 to Dec 25, 2011"},"duration":"28 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.28,"scored_by":844843,"rank":270,"popularity":74,"members":1472743,"favorites":33427,"synopsis":"With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor.

Until one day, a man in fiery red clothing declared to the whole universe: \"In the deepest part of black hole, lies a mysterious place called Rainbow Sea.
