While Rikuo tries to reveal Sammy's intentions, he begins to question the legitimacy of the fear that drives humans to regard androids as nothing more than mere tools.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":324,"type":"anime","name":"Directions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/324/Directions"},{"mal_id":325,"type":"anime","name":"Code","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/325/Code"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":595,"type":"anime","name":"NYAV Post","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post"},{"mal_id":1467,"type":"anime","name":"Pied Piper","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1467/Pied_Piper"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":84,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Rikka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/84/Studio_Rikka"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8479,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8479/Hetalia_World_Series","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75792l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hetalia World Series"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ヘタリア Ｗorld Series"},{"type":"English","title":"Hetalia World Series"}],"title":"Hetalia World Series","title_english":"Hetalia World Series","title_japanese":"ヘタリア Ｗorld Series","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Web manga","episodes":48,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":2010},"to":{"day":11,"month":3,"year":2011}},"string":"Mar 26, 2010 to Mar 11, 2011"},"duration":"5 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.45,"scored_by":56905,"rank":1962,"popularity":1882,"members":109755,"favorites":825,"synopsis":"The pasta-loving North Italy, stalwart Germany, and timid Japan continue their misadventures through history as they reenact various events leading up to and during the Second World War.

Choo describes the story as follows:\n\nSince a few years ago, there have been many cases of arson.\nIn the rural town of Kiyotaki, situated in a beautiful mountain valley, the town folks are talking about the legendary arsonist, Akaneko [赤猫].\n\nThe police have completely given up on Akaneko, who has slipped through their fingers every time.\n\nThe town's only hope is its one and only firefighting team—the Mizuneko [水猫] Fire Brigade. But because of their destructive fire fighting ways, they too are feared by the town folk. Almost every night, Akaneko and the Mizuneko Fire Brigade fight fiercely, taking down many of the town's buildings in the process. The Mizuneko Fire Brigade have depleted most of the town's financial resources so the town ends up on the verge of bankruptcy. The town was in a critical state when Chinka, a girl with a superhuman ability to smell out fires appears. With her powers, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade close in on the true identity of Akaneko...\n\n(Source: ANN, paraphrased)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1248,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai Fusion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1248/Mirai_Fusion"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":32644,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32644/Yaseruyagi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/81478l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Yaseruyagi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"やせるやぎ"}],"title":"Yaseruyagi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"やせるやぎ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":28,"month":3,"year":2010},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 28, 2010"},"duration":"37 sec","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.08,"scored_by":246,"rank":12389,"popularity":15427,"members":498,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A story about granny, her granddaughter and a goat. \n\n(Source: Official site)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":38378,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38378/Lei_Su_Deng_Shandian_Chong_Xian_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1400/94788l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Lei Su Deng Shandian Chong Xian 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Race-Tin: Flash & Dash 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"雷速登闪电冲线2"},{"type":"English","title":"Flash & Dash 2"}],"title":"Lei Su Deng Shandian Chong Xian 2","title_english":"Flash & Dash 2","title_japanese":"雷速登闪电冲线2","title_synonyms":["Race-Tin: Flash & Dash 2"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":40,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":2010},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"2010"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.79,"scored_by":228,"rank":10225,"popularity":15517,"members":488,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"The second season of Lei Su Deng Shandian Chong Xian.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":2170,"type":"anime","name":"Alpha Group Co.

In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.\n\nInitial A\nRikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Akaya Kirihara always seems to get himself into sticky situations. Out on a shopping trip with Bunta Marui and Jackal Kuwahara, Kirihara bumps into Seishun's Takashi Kawamura, causing a stuffed toy Kawamura was carrying to go flying into a nearby dog's mouth.

Ootori's doubles partner, Ryou Shishido, states that between him and Wakashi Hiyoshi, he would choose Hiyoshi to lead Hyoutei. This upsets Ootori greatly and the two end up fighting during practice. In an effort to cool down, Shishido sets out to train on his own but runs into Seishun's Kaoru Kaidou, who offers his two cents on his situation.\n\nDocchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)\nAfter knocking over a display stand, Higa Middle School's Yuujirou Kai bumps into Hyoutei's Hiyoshi, knocking his contact right out of his eye. As Hiyoshi searches for his missing contact, his teammate Yuushi Oshitari and Seishun's Sadaharu Inui begin to argue over what type of glasses would best suit him.\n\nUnabara-matsu! (The Ocean Festival)\nSeishun's Ryouma Echizen and Takeshi Momoshiro are invited by Rikkai's Genichirou Sanada to their school's Ocean Festival.

The young Dr. Junod, who has been working in a hospital in Mulhouse, France, is heading to Ethiopia as a delegate of the ICRC. Time travelers Mii and Yuko set off along Dr. Junod's path of hardship and turmoil. In Ethiopia, Dr. Junod witnesses attacks on Red Cross workers and the use of poison gas. One after another people are felled. The young doctor sees firsthand the horrors of war, but buoyed by an indomitable spirit he willingly offers a helping hand to those who are suffering as a result of the war.\n\nDr. Junod's work takes him from Ethiopia to Spain and across the European battlefields of World War II. He works to improve the treatment of prisoners of war and arranges prisoner exchanges. He establishes a method for prisoners and their families to write to each other. He secures routes for the delivery of relief supplies. As a humanitarian, Dr. Junod offers moral support to the weak. Seeing that, Mii and Yuko reflect on their own lives and problems.\n\n(Source: Official website)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"Medical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":18375,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/18375/Kaitou_Reinya_Pilot","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49277l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kaitou Reinya Pilot"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"「怪盗レーニャ」パイロット版"}],"title":"Kaitou Reinya Pilot","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"「怪盗レーニャ」パイロット版","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":6,"year":2010},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 25, 2010"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":5.16,"scored_by":482,"rank":12246,"popularity":13268,"members":915,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Pilot episode included as a bonus on the DVD.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1436,"type":"anime","name":"Stingray","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1436/Stingray"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":31246,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31246/Choegang_Habche__Mix_Master","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75089l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Choegang Habche: Mix Master"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"최강 합체 믹스마스터"},{"type":"English","title":"Mix Master: Final Force"}],"title":"Choegang Habche: Mix Master","title_english":"Mix Master: Final Force","title_japanese":"최강 합체 믹스마스터","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":39,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2011-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":26,"month":5,"year":2010},"to":{"day":16,"month":3,"year":2011}},"string":"May 26, 2010 to Mar 16, 2011"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.87,"scored_by":201,"rank":9882,"popularity":13466,"members":865,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Mix Masters Final Force is the second season of the original mix masters show.

On a moonlit night, the storylines converge in a teahouse near the city rampart. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":"The film won Best Animated Feature Film at the 4th Asia Pacific Screen Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8959,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8959/Nanchatte","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/24825l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nanchatte!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"なんちゃって!"}],"title":"Nanchatte!","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"なんちゃって!","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Unknown","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":5,"year":2010},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 14, 2010"},"duration":"53 sec per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":19101,"popularity":17197,"members":344,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A satire gag story about politics for adults.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":32646,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32646/Tsuzuki_wo_Kangaeru_Monogatari","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/78363l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tsuzuki wo Kangaeru Monogatari"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"つづきを考える物語"}],"title":"Tsuzuki wo Kangaeru Monogatari","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"つづきを考える物語","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"Original","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2010-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2010-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":18,"month":4,"year":2010},"to":{"day":5,"month":12,"year":2010}},"string":"Apr 18, 2010 to Dec 5, 2010"},"duration":"30 sec per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":13776,"popularity":18000,"members":288,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A series of commercials created to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the SEKISUI Heim brand of modular homes.

However, little does he know that Miisu expects him to do tasks beyond the duties of a regular servant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":266,"type":"anime","name":"Natural High","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/266/Natural_High"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":557,"type":"anime","name":"Zyc","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/557/Zyc"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9907,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9907/Bokura_no_Live_Kimi_to_no_Life","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/50113l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bokura no Live Kimi to no Life"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Love Live!

Yet it had the face of the \"SHINDU\" which by force would take away the children. They were called \"SARAIYA\" among the children. Children ran away all at once, but Takashi couldn't make it and was caught and taken into the car. The other children and \"TEN\" prayed, saying \"This can't be helped.\" The car went through a big gate and arrived at the place called \"JAIL\".

As the lines between friends and foes get blurred, Ichigo will have to face his most challenging dilemma yet—a decision that may well engulf the three worlds into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":8557,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8557/Shinryaku_Ika_Musume","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1734/118930l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"rmAa-lK7C2A","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmAa-lK7C2A","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmAa-lK7C2A?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rmAa-lK7C2A/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rmAa-lK7C2A/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rmAa-lK7C2A/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rmAa-lK7C2A/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rmAa-lK7C2A/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shinryaku!
