This utopia is the sole salvation for the remnants of life in this barren land, but the legend also dictates that only wolves can find their way to this mythical realm. Though long thought to be extinct, wolves still exist and live amongst humans, disguising themselves through elaborate illusions. \n\nA lone wolf named Kiba finds himself drawn by an intoxicating scent to Freeze City, an impoverished town under the rule of the callous Lord Orkham. Here, Kiba discovers that wolves Hige, Tsume, and Toboe have been drawn in by the same aroma. By following the fragrance of \"Lunar Flowers,\" said to be the key to opening the door to their ideal world, the wolves set off on a journey across desolate landscapes and crumbling cities to find their legendary promised land. However, they are not the only ones seeking paradise, and those with more sinister intentions will do anything in their power to reach it first.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"02:10","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 02:10 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":142,"type":"anime","name":"Asatsu DK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/142/Asatsu_DK"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":138,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/138/Hunter_x_Hunter__Greed_Island","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/122320l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hunter X Hunter OVA 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"HUNTER×HUNTER Greed Island"}],"title":"Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"HUNTER×HUNTER Greed Island","title_synonyms":["Hunter X Hunter OVA 2"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":8,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2003-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":2,"year":2003},"to":{"day":16,"month":4,"year":2003}},"string":"Feb 5, 2003 to Apr 16, 2003"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.18,"scored_by":84071,"rank":387,"popularity":1456,"members":153006,"favorites":288,"synopsis":"After the battle with the Spiders, the search for Ging continues as Gon and Killua decided to once again attempt to purchase the rare game \"Greed Island.\" However, Gon came up with a better plan, which was to volunteer to complete the game for the billionaire who owned it.

While Munto sets off on the dangerous journey, the other kingdoms attempt to destroy the Magical Kingdom and acquire the remaining Akuto for themselves.\n\nOn Earth, Yumemi Hidaka is dealing with her own problems. She can see floating islands in the sky that nobody else can. While her best friend Ichiko Ono believes her, Yumemi wonders if she is going insane. When Munto suddenly appears before her, Yumemi dismisses him as a mere delusion. She is more concerned about her 13-year-old friend Suzume Imamura, who is attempting to elope with her delinquent boyfriend. As the Magical Kingdom nears the point where it will fall from the sky, Munto's quest to save both the Heavens and Earth grows increasingly desperate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":266,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/266/Gunparade_March__Arata_Naru_Kougunka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75520l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"SOnI9g_LDFc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnI9g_LDFc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOnI9g_LDFc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/SOnI9g_LDFc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ガンパレード・マーチ -新たなる行軍歌-"},{"type":"English","title":"Gunparade March: A New Song for the March"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Gunparade March"}],"title":"Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka","title_english":"Gunparade March: A New Song for the March","title_japanese":"ガンパレード・マーチ -新たなる行軍歌-","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2003-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":2,"year":2003},"to":{"day":24,"month":4,"year":2003}},"string":"Feb 6, 2003 to Apr 24, 2003"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.73,"scored_by":6095,"rank":5374,"popularity":5081,"members":16482,"favorites":23,"synopsis":"It began in 1945, at the end of the Pacific War.

Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives. \n\nIt is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world. They do not attempt to change or influence the places they visit, despite how absurd these values would appear. That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that \"the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":33,"type":"anime","name":"WOWOW","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":412,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Wombat","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/412/Studio_Wombat"},{"mal_id":665,"type":"anime","name":"chara-ani.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/665/chara-anicom"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":26,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1027/131977l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Z19QTGvwg9I","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z19QTGvwg9I","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z19QTGvwg9I?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z19QTGvwg9I/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z19QTGvwg9I/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z19QTGvwg9I/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z19QTGvwg9I/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z19QTGvwg9I/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Texhnolyze"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Technolyze"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"TEXHNOLYZE"},{"type":"English","title":"Texhnolyze"}],"title":"Texhnolyze","title_english":"Texhnolyze","title_japanese":"TEXHNOLYZE","title_synonyms":["Technolyze"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":22,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2003-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":4,"year":2003},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2003}},"string":"Apr 17, 2003 to Sep 25, 2003"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":7.76,"scored_by":56090,"rank":1034,"popularity":944,"members":245589,"favorites":4942,"synopsis":"In the dark underground city of Lux, people live in fear and despair under the rule of various criminal factions.

The latter have the particularity not to trigger an immune response in their hosts and the \"Class\" has the privilege to conduct research on them. This elusive organization, also in charge of the raffia production, delegates its executive authority to a group called Organo led by Keigo Oonishi—a self-righteous man with texhnolyzed legs who is rumored to hear the \"voice of the city.\"\n\nThe fragile balance of powers in Lux is disturbed when a mysterious visitor named Kazuho Yoshii begins committing a series of crimes that puts the gangs at each other's throats. In the midst of the chaos, new actors emerge: Ichise, an ex-boxer mutilated by Organo and recently texhnolyzed by Eriko \"Doc\" Kamata; and Ran, a young florist who can see the future. While Lux steadily plunges into insanity, both Ichise and Ran find themselves involved in the greatest crisis the city has ever faced.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Texhnolyze was released on DVD in six volumes by Geneon Entertainment Inc. from April 6, 2004 to February 22, 2005.

Though Daisuke is unaware of this strange heritage, his mother is certainly not: since before the boy was born, his mother had been planning for him to steal valuable works of art and let the name of the elusive art thief be known.\n\nWith doubt and confusion constantly clouding his mind, Daisuke finds himself struggling in his relationships with classmates and family.

Human Crossing examines the lives of a boxer whose dark past is rekindled by his estranged mother in \"The Wound\", an idealistic lawyer who fights for an underprivileged young mother in \"The 25th Hour\", a workaholic businessman who rediscovers what's most important in life in \"A Promise\", and an independent woman who reunites with her deadbeat father in \"Direction.\"\n\nHuman Crossing is a collection of vignettes about hope, a reminder of the small victories one can achieve amid the vicissitudes of life. \n\n(Source: Geneon, edited)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"OB Planning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/67/OB_Planning"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":490,"type":"anime","name":"Maiden Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":1039,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1039/Mizuiro_2003","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/49473l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mizuiro (2003)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mizuiro OVA 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"みずいろ (2003)"}],"title":"Mizuiro (2003)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"みずいろ (2003)","title_synonyms":["Mizuiro OVA 2"],"type":"OVA","source":"Visual novel","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2003-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":4,"year":2003},"to":{"day":10,"month":10,"year":2003}},"string":"Apr 25, 2003 to Oct 10, 2003"},"duration":"29 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.31,"scored_by":1629,"rank":7674,"popularity":8889,"members":3935,"favorites":2,"synopsis":"Brother and younger sister-in-law live in the house which parents are often away from.

Human life as we know it is almost extinct, and only a few were able to pull through the collapse of Earth's ecosystem. In order to deal with the chaos, a city named Ecoban was created. The city uses the very pollution that caused the disaster as an energy source.\n\nHowever, although the initial plan was successful to an extent, it didn't just create a new source of energy, but also an elite group of people. This prestigious faction believes that they are above the system, and are not willing to accept survivors from outside the city unless they are put to work as laborers.\n\nAmong the people living in the wasteland outside Ecoban is a young man named Shua. He leads a very difficult life, but tries to make the most of it through the love that he feels for his childhood friend Jay. Unfortunately, Jay may be more interested in her security commander Cade than in Shua, and thus a love triangle is formed. Not only does Shua have to deal with the heartbreak, but he must also find a new way to survive in the crumbles left from the once-beautiful planet Earth.","background":"During the production of Wonderful Days, one of two available prototypes of the Frazier lens was used during filming.

Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower's exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth's solar system.\n\nVan, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He's deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.\n\nMeanwhile, earth's deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet's orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador's vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.\n\nVan's deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":2444,"type":"anime","name":"Hanho Heung-Up","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2444/Hanho_Heung-Up"},{"mal_id":2445,"type":"anime","name":"Big Film Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2445/Big_Film_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"},{"mal_id":1231,"type":"anime","name":"OLM Digital","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1231/OLM_Digital"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37789,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37789/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki_3rd_Season_Picture_Drama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/92078l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tenchi Muyou!

With his supreme alchemy skills, Edward binds Alphonse's soul to a large suit of armor.\n\nA year later, Edward, now promoted to the fullmetal alchemist of the state, embarks on a journey with his younger brother to obtain the Philosopher's Stone. The fabled mythical object is rumored to be capable of amplifying an alchemist's abilities by leaps and bounds, thus allowing them to override the fundamental law of alchemy: to gain something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of equal value. Edward hopes to draw into the military's resources to find the fabled stone and restore his and Alphonse's bodies to normal. However, the Elric brothers soon discover that there is more to the legendary stone than meets the eye, as they are led to the epicenter of a far darker battle than they could have ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Fullmetal Alchemist won the TV Feature Award in the 9th Animation Kobe Awards and was one of the Jury Recommended Works in the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival in the anime division.

Advancements in science and technology have led to the colonization of the moon, the commercialization of outer space, and the formation of large space corporations. Ai Tanabe, an upbeat woman whose interests lie in the cosmos, joins Technora Corporation as a member of their Debris Section, a department dedicated to the removal of dangerous space junk between the orbits of the Earth and Moon.\n\nHowever, Ai soon discovers how unappreciated her job is. As the laughingstock of Technora, the Debris Section is severely understaffed, poorly funded, and is forced to use a dilapidated spaceship nicknamed the \"Toy Box\" for debris retrieval. Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section's staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirouta Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.\n\nPlanetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people—people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Planetes is the winner of the 2005 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in science fiction.","season":"fall","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"08:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 08:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":60,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60/Chrno_Crusade","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/14141l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"BRLC0zVfjL0","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRLC0zVfjL0","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRLC0zVfjL0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRLC0zVfjL0/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRLC0zVfjL0/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRLC0zVfjL0/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRLC0zVfjL0/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRLC0zVfjL0/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Chrno Crusade"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Chrono Crusade: Mary Magdalene"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"クロノクルセイド"},{"type":"English","title":"Chrono Crusade"},{"type":"German","title":"Chrono Crusade"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Chrono Crusade"},{"type":"French","title":"Chrono Crusade"}],"title":"Chrno Crusade","title_english":"Chrono Crusade","title_japanese":"クロノクルセイド","title_synonyms":["Chrono Crusade: Mary Magdalene"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2004-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":11,"year":2003},"to":{"day":10,"month":6,"year":2004}},"string":"Nov 25, 2003 to Jun 10, 2004"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.61,"scored_by":103398,"rank":1419,"popularity":1037,"members":223966,"favorites":1946,"synopsis":"The 1920s was a decade of great change and upheaval, with monstrous demons appearing across America.

When he finally finds one, he discovers that she and her companions have been raising a girl to be their food so they can eat her and take on her youthful looks. That is how mermaids stay young.

It is based upon the renga of the same name by the 17th century Japanese poet Basho. The creation of the film followed the traditional collaborative nature of the source material—the visuals for each of the 36 stanzas were independently created by 35 different animators. As well as many Japanese animators, Kawamoto assembled leading names of animation from across the world. Each animator was asked to contribute at least 30 seconds to illustrate their stanza, and most of the sequences are under a minute (Yuriy Norshteyn's, though, is nearly two minutes long). The released film consists of the 40-minute animation, followed by an hour-long \"Making of\" documentary, including interviews with the animators. Fuyu no Hi won the Grand Prize of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2003.

Suddenly, when they defeat a boss, a strange thing pops up in front of them, and they're sucked into the game world! Tomoru (scorer), Mio, and Dai end up together with Professor Galileo, who tells them that he's the one that created this game that they`ve appeared in, called Eureka, but he inadvertently got sucked into it as well. In order to get back to their world, they need to clear missions that pop up in certain areas of the world. So when a mission appears, Tomoru and the gang make the professor take them along.\n\nWhen they get to area C-1, they find that not only do they have a mission, but they have a rival group! The rival professor has brought their rivals from the soccer game, Yukio, Suzuka, and Kouta, with him! Their mission, of course, is a scientific one. First the computer explains how lightning is formed, and then they have to figure out a way to stop the lightning to clear the mission! Tomoru and company manage to get it done, and get a Eureka Stone, letting them get back to their world! Except... the gateway back actually needs ten Eureka Stones total before it will open! Sounds like there's a lot of science to be learned and missions to be cleared before they can go home.\n\n(Source: Jascii.net)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":318,"type":"anime","name":"WAO World","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/318/WAO_World"},{"mal_id":340,"type":"anime","name":"Future Planet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/340/Future_Planet"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":21121,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21121/Heart_Cocktail_Again","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/55753l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Heart Cocktail Again"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハートカクテルアゲイン"}],"title":"Heart Cocktail Again","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ハートカクテルアゲイン","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":22,"month":10,"year":2003},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 22, 2003"},"duration":"41 min","rating":"PG-13 -
