Although it presents a great risk to their careers, Kazuki and Rei—both assuming the affectionate nickname \"papa\"—decide to provide Miri with a normal childhood despite all the odds stacked against them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Buddy Daddies was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from March 22, 2023, to August 23, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":459,"type":"anime","name":"Nitroplus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/459/Nitroplus"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Koori Zokusei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from April 28, 2023, to July 27, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"},{"mal_id":2185,"type":"anime","name":"BS Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2185/BS_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2425,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Music Live","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live"},{"mal_id":2671,"type":"anime","name":"Saber Links","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2671/Saber_Links"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"},{"mal_id":2527,"type":"anime","name":"Liber","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2527/Liber"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":50932,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50932/Saikyou_Onmyouji_no_Isekai_Tenseiki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/125900l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"6bYBB5ZF5a8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bYBB5ZF5a8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bYBB5ZF5a8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bYBB5ZF5a8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bYBB5ZF5a8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bYBB5ZF5a8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bYBB5ZF5a8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bYBB5ZF5a8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Reincarnation of the Strongest Onmyouji in Another World"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"最強陰陽師の異世界転生記"},{"type":"English","title":"The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World"}],"title":"Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki","title_english":"The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World","title_japanese":"最強陰陽師の異世界転生記","title_synonyms":["The Reincarnation of the Strongest Onmyouji in Another World"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":2023},"to":{"day":1,"month":4,"year":2023}},"string":"Jan 7, 2023 to Apr 1, 2023"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.18,"scored_by":95070,"rank":3279,"popularity":1266,"members":181186,"favorites":877,"synopsis":"Despite standing at the zenith as the strongest exorcist, Haruyoshi Kuga sought even greater power, which led to his demise at the hands of those who envied his might.

Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée.

As unknown groups of evil spirits begin to jeopardize the balance between worlds, the young man must gain the trust of Botan and overcome his hatred for her mysterious family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mononogatari was released on Blu-ray in two volumes from April 5, 2023, to June 2, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":474,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/474/Shogakukan_Music___Digital_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1574,"type":"anime","name":"Quaras","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1574/Quaras"},{"mal_id":2289,"type":"anime","name":"GREE Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2289/GREE_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":2425,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Music Live","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live"},{"mal_id":2431,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Phantom Studios","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2431/Happinet_Phantom_Studios"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1258,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1258/Bandai_Namco_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":52826,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52826/Tsurune__Tsunagari_no_Issha","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/132337l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"PC2w_ETFQDQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC2w_ETFQDQ","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PC2w_ETFQDQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PC2w_ETFQDQ/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PC2w_ETFQDQ/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PC2w_ETFQDQ/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PC2w_ETFQDQ/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PC2w_ETFQDQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tsurune: Tsunagari no Issha"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tsurune 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ツルネ ―つながりの一射―"},{"type":"English","title":"Tsurune - The Linking Shot -"}],"title":"Tsurune: Tsunagari no Issha","title_english":"Tsurune - The Linking Shot -","title_japanese":"ツルネ ―つながりの一射―","title_synonyms":["Tsurune 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":1,"year":2023},"to":{"day":30,"month":3,"year":2023}},"string":"Jan 5, 2023 to Mar 30, 2023"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.1,"scored_by":13508,"rank":472,"popularity":3009,"members":49681,"favorites":376,"synopsis":"Despite the prefectural tournament's breathtaking conclusion, the Kazemai High School Kyudo Club has no time to celebrate.

His obsessive-compulsive disorder has limited him in every aspect, from being unable to leave the house without a pair of gloves on, to cleaning his hands vigorously enough to make them bleed.\n\nWhen the president gets into an accident, he is saved by a mysterious young man who departs as quickly as he appears. Ordered to go after him, Shirotani meets Riku Kurose, a man who is able to quickly identify his mysophobia. Begrudgingly taking his advice to seek help from a professional, Shirotani visits Shimada Psychosomatics with the hope of seeing a psychiatrist. When he once again runs into Kurose there, the man reveals that he himself is a counselor at the clinic, and offers to treat Shirotani's condition.\n\nKurose asks him to write a list of 10 things he is reluctant to do—thus beginning his course of exposure therapy. Yet, Shirotani wonders why Kurose would show such kindness to a stranger. After all, the two have barely met, and Kurose does not deny the accusations of an ulterior motive.\n\nWith number 10 on the list left blank by an undecided Shirotani, Kurose issues a challenge. Once Shirotani figures out the last item, the thing he would hate to do the most, only then will his newfound counselor finally tell him the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":118,"type":"anime","name":"SynergySP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/118/SynergySP"},{"mal_id":2455,"type":"anime","name":"East Fish Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2455/East_Fish_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52274,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52274/Nokemono-tachi_no_Yoru","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1087/129002l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"dSQ1oBUuoGA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSQ1oBUuoGA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSQ1oBUuoGA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dSQ1oBUuoGA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dSQ1oBUuoGA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dSQ1oBUuoGA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dSQ1oBUuoGA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dSQ1oBUuoGA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Nokemono-tachi no Yoru"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ノケモノたちの夜"},{"type":"English","title":"The Tale of Outcasts"}],"title":"Nokemono-tachi no Yoru","title_english":"The Tale of Outcasts","title_japanese":"ノケモノたちの夜","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2023},"to":{"day":2,"month":4,"year":2023}},"string":"Jan 8, 2023 to Apr 2, 2023"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.59,"scored_by":11494,"rank":6098,"popularity":3478,"members":38209,"favorites":115,"synopsis":"Wisteria is an orphan girl living in a corner of the British Empire at the end of the 19th century.

The men there were all hot-blooded and the women were all strong-willed. Their kingdom was called Qingyang.\n\nThe story is set in Qingyang and depicts the power struggles within the northern nomadic tribes, as well as the grievances between Qingyang and the East Land. As a child, the Qingyang crown prince Lü Guichen was sent to live with the Yanzhen Tribe by the Great Lord. After the tribe rebelled, Lü Guichen was brought back to Beidu city. However, his older brothers did not value this young and weak crown prince, instead focusing solely on competing against each other for the throne's succession. Yet, after experiencing the baptism of war and the ups and downs of life, Lü Guichen, with his gentle personality, gradually matured and gained strength amidst his older brothers' power struggles...\n\nDuring that time, the royal family of the East Lands was in decline, and several feudal states had emerged. The Great Lord of Qingyang sought to use an alliance with the Xia Tang State to achieve his ambition of dominating the East. As a result, Lü Guichen was sent as a hostage to Xia Tang. It was there that he met the unruly Tianqu warrior, Jiye, and was drawn to Jiye's tenacious and unyielding spirit, eventually becoming close friends. This is the story of the young Zhaowu Duke and the young Yulie King of the Xie Dynasty-to-be.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1727,"type":"anime","name":"Tencent Penguin Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1727/Tencent_Penguin_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2055,"type":"anime","name":"BYMENT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2055/BYMENT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":54737,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/54737/Bai_Lian_Feisheng_Lu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/135113l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bai Lian Feisheng Lu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"百炼飞升录"},{"type":"English","title":"Hundred Refining Soaring Record"}],"title":"Bai Lian Feisheng Lu","title_english":"Hundred Refining Soaring Record","title_japanese":"百炼飞升录","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Web novel","episodes":60,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":24,"month":3,"year":2023},"to":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":2023}},"string":"Mar 24, 2023 to Oct 6, 2023"},"duration":"11 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":15413,"popularity":15488,"members":491,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Qin Fengming, a teenager in the mountain village, ate nine leaves of Yin and Yang fruit by mistake, so he stepped onto the road of cultivating truth, refining artifacts, collecting magic weapons, and protecting the right path!

Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally live in peace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1747,"type":"anime","name":"Twin Engine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1747/Twin_Engine"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":48549,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48549/Dr_Stone__New_World","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/136268l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"bITRcLr4xR8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bITRcLr4xR8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bITRcLr4xR8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bITRcLr4xR8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bITRcLr4xR8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bITRcLr4xR8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bITRcLr4xR8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bITRcLr4xR8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dr. Stone: New World"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dr. Stone 3rd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Dr.STONE NEW WORLD"}],"title":"Dr. Stone: New World","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"Dr.STONE NEW WORLD","title_synonyms":["Dr. Stone 3rd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":4,"year":2023},"to":{"day":15,"month":6,"year":2023}},"string":"Apr 6, 2023 to Jun 15, 2023"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.15,"scored_by":158151,"rank":422,"popularity":542,"members":406992,"favorites":2956,"synopsis":"With the ambitious Ryuusui Nanami on board, Senkuu Ishigami and his team are almost ready to sail the seas and reach the other side of the world—where the bizarre green light that petrified humanity originated.

This good deed allows him to be reborn with all his memories in another world as Cain von Silford, the third son of a margrave.\n\nWhen Cain turns five, a baptismal ceremony in the church grants him an audience to the seven gods who preside over the world. Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections—allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.\n\nWith these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true.

Exuding unshakeable confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from October 18, 2023, to May 22, 2024.","season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"23:56","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 23:56 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"},{"mal_id":2260,"type":"anime","name":"Sumzap","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2260/Sumzap"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":51179,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51179/Mushoku_Tensei_II__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/138005l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"keti2rbgI6c","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keti2rbgI6c","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/keti2rbgI6c?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/keti2rbgI6c/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/keti2rbgI6c/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/keti2rbgI6c/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/keti2rbgI6c/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/keti2rbgI6c/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Jobless Reincarnation: I Will Seriously Try If I Go To Another World"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"無職転生 II ～異世界行ったら本気だす～"},{"type":"English","title":"Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation Season 2"}],"title":"Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu","title_english":"Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation Season 2","title_japanese":"無職転生 II ～異世界行ったら本気だす～","title_synonyms":["Jobless Reincarnation: I Will Seriously Try If I Go To Another World","Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":7,"year":2023},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2023}},"string":"Jul 10, 2023 to Sep 25, 2023"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.32,"scored_by":201961,"rank":235,"popularity":487,"members":445614,"favorites":6009,"synopsis":"After his relationship with Eris Boreas Greyrat reaches new heights, Rudeus Greyrat is ecstatic.

Seeing that spirits are so attracted to Keitarou, she ropes him into helping her collect other evil spirits that will assist in her future fight. Although her quest is dangerous, Keitarou reluctantly decides to join her, even as each new spirit they meet has him questioning his resolve at every turn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Dark Gathering was released on Blu-ray in six volumes from October 18, 2023, to March 20, 2024.","season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1412,"type":"anime","name":"Kansai Telecasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1412/Kansai_Telecasting"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"},{"mal_id":2185,"type":"anime","name":"BS Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2185/BS_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2684,"type":"anime","name":"CHOCOLATE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2684/CHOCOLATE"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":50613,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50613/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_2023","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/136532l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"fnadhlsEqeU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnadhlsEqeU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnadhlsEqeU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fnadhlsEqeU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fnadhlsEqeU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fnadhlsEqeU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fnadhlsEqeU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/fnadhlsEqeU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"るろうに剣心 -明治剣客浪漫譚-"}],"title":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"るろうに剣心 -明治剣客浪漫譚-","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2023-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":7,"year":2023},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 7, 2023 to ?"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.66,"scored_by":16978,"rank":1284,"popularity":2039,"members":97106,"favorites":586,"synopsis":"In the late 19th century, as the cruel times of the Bakumatsu period came to a close, a new Meiji era marked the age of restoration for Japan. With the war over, its infamous hero Hitokiri Battousai disappeared into thin air, leaving only his legend behind.\n\nYears later, a seemingly plain wanderer named Kenshin Himura encounters Kaoru Kamiya, the owner of a struggling local dojo in Tokyo. Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu—a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023) is a remake of the original adaptation, utilizing new animation technology to make it appealing to both new viewers and returning audiences of the series.

But as the demon learns more about the events that transpired in the decade of his absence, he realizes that there is a story behind Max's downfall that he knows nothing of.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from September 27, 2023, to November 29, 2023.","season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":797,"type":"anime","name":"Houbunsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/797/Houbunsha"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"},{"mal_id":1547,"type":"anime","name":"Blade","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1547/Blade"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":55454,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/55454/Shuumatsu_no_Walküre_II_Part_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/136099l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"OtHiAWIV4WY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtHiAWIV4WY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtHiAWIV4WY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtHiAWIV4WY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtHiAWIV4WY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtHiAWIV4WY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtHiAWIV4WY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtHiAWIV4WY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shuumatsu no Walküre II Part 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"終末のワルキューレII 後編"},{"type":"English","title":"Record of Ragnarok II Part 2"}],"title":"Shuumatsu no Walküre II Part 2","title_english":"Record of Ragnarok II Part 2","title_japanese":"終末のワルキューレII 後編","title_synonyms":[],"type":"ONA","source":"Manga","episodes":5,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":7,"year":2023},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 12, 2023"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.56,"scored_by":29592,"rank":1589,"popularity":2932,"members":52506,"favorites":157,"synopsis":"Second part of Shuumatsu no Walküre II.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":415,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Bros.

With each new advance, it becomes more difficult to define what truly makes one human or Humanoid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"AI no Idenshi was released on Blu-ray on November 8, 2023.","season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:53","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:53 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":513,"type":"anime","name":"Nikkatsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/513/Nikkatsu"},{"mal_id":1373,"type":"anime","name":"Akita Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1373/Akita_Shoten"},{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"},{"mal_id":2788,"type":"anime","name":"Hero Garage","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2788/Hero_Garage"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":53428,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53428/Ayaka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/136367l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"x3z_RZ32UFY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3z_RZ32UFY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3z_RZ32UFY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/x3z_RZ32UFY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/x3z_RZ32UFY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/x3z_RZ32UFY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/x3z_RZ32UFY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/x3z_RZ32UFY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ayaka"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"AYAKA ‐あやか‐"},{"type":"English","title":"Ayaka: A Story of Bonds and Wounds"}],"title":"Ayaka","title_english":"Ayaka: A Story of Bonds and Wounds","title_japanese":"AYAKA ‐あやか‐","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":7,"year":2023},"to":{"day":17,"month":9,"year":2023}},"string":"Jul 2, 2023 to Sep 17, 2023"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.44,"scored_by":10566,"rank":6975,"popularity":3524,"members":37378,"favorites":123,"synopsis":"Ten years ago, a volcanic eruption brought Japan's Ayaka Islands to the brink of destruction.

She was doing well until she infiltrated a mansion, where she was captured after making a small mistake. \"Oh no, I have to escape somehow,\" she thought.But for Ajisai, who hoped for a chance to escape, a fate worse than death awaited. With her senses heightened by an aphrodisiac, she is subjected to a variety of tortures and sexual pleasures using different instruments.

For the past 10 years, Fuuko has been afflicted by a condition that brings extreme misfortune to anyone who touches her. This has had a drastic effect on her surroundings, even inadvertently resulting in the deaths of those around her—including her parents.\n\nAs she stands on a bridge above train tracks, Fuuko is touched by a strange man, causing the footing underneath him to break and dropping him in front of an oncoming train.

Following the advice of one of his seniors, he ventures out to enlist the aid of the reclusive Ron Kamonohashi. Five years ago, Ron was the most promising detective from the illustrious Detective Training Academy Blue; yet for reasons unknown to the public, he sank into obscurity.\n\nTotomaru expects a well-dressed, composed man; but what he gets is a messy-haired and uninhibited eccentric. After years in solitude, Ron barely resembles his former self and he refuses to even hear out the detective. However, as quickly as Ron rebuffs, he flips on a dime and dives headfirst into the current serial murder case.\n\nThe true reason Ron withdrew from the detective world was not from lack of desire, but rather from something out of his control—and Totomaru might just be the key for his return to his former calling. Together, the wide-eyed officer and deranged detective tackle each mystery that comes their way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Kamonohashi Ron no Kindan Suiri was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from January 24, 2024, to March 27, 2024.","season":"fall","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1390,"type":"anime","name":"Toy's Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1390/Toys_Factory"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Diomedéa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/51/Diomed%C3%A9a"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":53888,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53888/Spy_x_Family_Movie__Code__White","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1426/139388l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"3sHxvyk57jY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sHxvyk57jY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sHxvyk57jY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3sHxvyk57jY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3sHxvyk57jY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3sHxvyk57jY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3sHxvyk57jY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3sHxvyk57jY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Spy x Family Movie: Code: White"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"SPY×FAMILY CODE: White"},{"type":"English","title":"Spy x Family Code: White"}],"title":"Spy x Family Movie: Code: White","title_english":"Spy x Family Code: White","title_japanese":"SPY×FAMILY CODE: White","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Not yet aired","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":22,"month":12,"year":2023},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 22, 2023"},"duration":"2 hr","rating":"PG-13 -

Doing things such as collecting medicinal herbs, exterminating magic beasts and wild beasts, and helping with the villagers' farm work, it's hard to decide whether to call our protagonist an adventurer or a handyman. And while doing these things his age quickly approached thirty. One day while searching the mountains for herbs, he discovered an abandoned child. Thinking that he couldn't just leave the child, he took her home and raised her until his age approached forty.\n\nHis now grown-up daughter had also wanted to become an adventurer, likely from growing up watching her father. Although her father had taught her the sword since she was young for self-defense, her talent at it was quite impressive. Thinking that it would be better for her not to be stuck out in the country for the rest of her life, our protagonist sent her to the adventurer's guild in the Capital.\n\nAfter another five years, the protagonist now in his forties is still acting as a pseudo-adventurer in the countryside, however, his daughter—now a distinguished S-Class adventurer—hasn't returned home even once yet...\n\n(Source: MU, edited)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":925,"type":"anime","name":"Earth Star Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/925/Earth_Star_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1414,"type":"anime","name":"bilibili","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"},{"mal_id":1899,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1899/Good_Smile_Film"},{"mal_id":2228,"type":"anime","name":"Bushiroad Move","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2228/Bushiroad_Move"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1340,"type":"anime","name":"Typhoon Graphics","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1340/Typhoon_Graphics"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":56425,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/56425/Houkago_Shounen_Hanako-kun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/138031l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"h0w3Ws9sPBE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0w3Ws9sPBE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0w3Ws9sPBE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/h0w3Ws9sPBE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/h0w3Ws9sPBE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/h0w3Ws9sPBE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/h0w3Ws9sPBE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/h0w3Ws9sPBE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Houkago Shounen Hanako-kun"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"放課後少年花子くん"},{"type":"English","title":"After-School Hanako-kun"}],"title":"Houkago Shounen Hanako-kun","title_english":"After-School Hanako-kun","title_japanese":"放課後少年花子くん","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2023-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2023-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":10,"year":2023},"to":{"day":3,"month":11,"year":2023}},"string":"Oct 13, 2023 to Nov 3, 2023"},"duration":"10 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.07,"scored_by":6356,"rank":3828,"popularity":3275,"members":42594,"favorites":267,"synopsis":"The ghostly Hanako-kun and his mortal assistant, Nene Yashiro, usually have their hands full resolving various supernatural incidents in Kamome Academy, but how do they spend their time when they get a break from all that?

Self-driving electric cars have replaced internal combustion engine-based cars, becoming ubiquitous in Japan. However, a racing circuit known as MFG, which employs traditional internal combustion cars, is garnering popularity worldwide.\n\nKanata Livington, a 19-year-old Japanese-British racer, comes to Japan after graduating from a top racing school in the United Kingdom to take part in MFG and find his missing father, Ken Katagiri. Kanata moves to the home of his late mother's friends—Mr. and Mrs. Saionji—and enters the race under his father's surname, borrowing a Toyota 86 from Ogata, the couple's family friend. Despite the overwhelming disadvantages in specs, Kanata makes it to the top 15 while racing top-tier supercars, demonstrating his phenomenal skills.\n\nTakumi Fujiwara, the legendary downhill and rally racer, turns out to be Kanata's trainer. MFG employees who are familiar with Fujiwara and former racers from the same generation begin to notice Kanata.
