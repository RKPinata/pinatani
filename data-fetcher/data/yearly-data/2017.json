The dragon immediately transforms into a cute, busty, and energetic young girl dressed in a maid outfit, introducing herself as Tooru.\n\nIt turns out that the stoic programmer had come across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior's kindness by working as her personal maidservant. Though deeply regretful of her words and hesitant to follow through on her promise, a mix of guilt and Tooru's incredible dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to take the girl in.\n\nDespite being extremely efficient at her job, the maid's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up horrifying Kobayashi and at times bring more trouble than help. Furthermore, the circumstances behind the dragon's arrival on Earth seem to be much more complicated than at first glance, as Tooru bears some heavy emotions and painful memories. To top it all off, Tooru's presence ends up attracting several other mythical beings to her new home, bringing in a host of eccentric personalities. Although Kobayashi makes her best effort to handle the crazy situation that she has found herself in, nothing has prepared her for this new life with a dragon maid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":32615,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32615/Youjo_Senki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/82890l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"eQXrx39ImTI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQXrx39ImTI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQXrx39ImTI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/eQXrx39ImTI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/eQXrx39ImTI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/eQXrx39ImTI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/eQXrx39ImTI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/eQXrx39ImTI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Youjo Senki"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Military Chronicles of a Little Girl"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"幼女戦記"},{"type":"English","title":"Saga of Tanya the Evil"},{"type":"German","title":"Saga of Tanya the Evil"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Saga of Tanya the Evil (Youjo Senki)"},{"type":"French","title":"Saga of Tanya the Evil"}],"title":"Youjo Senki","title_english":"Saga of Tanya the Evil","title_japanese":"幼女戦記","title_synonyms":["The Military Chronicles of a Little Girl"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":1,"year":2017},"to":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":2017}},"string":"Jan 6, 2017 to Mar 31, 2017"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.96,"scored_by":486667,"rank":671,"popularity":182,"members":891707,"favorites":12079,"synopsis":"Tanya Degurechaff is a young soldier infamous for predatorial-like ruthlessness and an uncanny, tactical aptitude, earning her the nickname of the \"Devil of the Rhine.\" Underneath her innocuous appearance, however, lies the soul of a man who challenged Being X, the self-proclaimed God, to a battle of wits—which resulted in him being reincarnated as a little girl into a world of magical warfare.

As they spend their time on Earth, they meet two eccentric personalities: the angel Raphiel Ainsworth Shiraha, Gabriel's classmate with a penchant for sadism, and the demon Satanichia McDowell Kurumizawa, a clumsy self-proclaimed future ruler of the Underworld.\n\nGabriel DropOut follows these four friends' comedic lives as they utterly fail to understand what it truly means to be a demon or an angel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":737,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1614,"type":"anime","name":"NTT Plala","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1614/NTT_Plala"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Doga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":33988,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33988/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/83417l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"XaoWL6Lvyjo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaoWL6Lvyjo","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XaoWL6Lvyjo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/XaoWL6Lvyjo/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/XaoWL6Lvyjo/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/XaoWL6Lvyjo/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/XaoWL6Lvyjo/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/XaoWL6Lvyjo/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ajin-chan wa Kataritai"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"亜人ちゃんは語りたい"},{"type":"English","title":"Interviews With Monster Girls"},{"type":"German","title":"Interviews with Monster Girls"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Interviews with Monster Girls"},{"type":"French","title":"Interviews With Monster Girls"}],"title":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai","title_english":"Interviews With Monster Girls","title_japanese":"亜人ちゃんは語りたい","title_synonyms":["Ajin-chan wa Kataritai"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2017},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":2017}},"string":"Jan 8, 2017 to Mar 26, 2017"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.54,"scored_by":212640,"rank":1641,"popularity":538,"members":408587,"favorites":1487,"synopsis":"High school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi may look like your average everyday instructor, but beneath his gentle appearance lies something less ordinary: his fascination for the \"Ajin,\" more commonly known as \"Demi.\" Although these half-human, half-monster beings have integrated into human society, Takahashi believes that much about them will remain unknown unless he interacts with them firsthand.\n\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai follows Takahashi's daily life in Shibasaki High School together with his three Demi students—Hikari Takanashi, an energetic vampire; Kyouko Machi, a gentle dullahan; and Yuki Kusakabe, the shy snow woman.

Despite these overpowering creatures being capable of leveling entire battlefields, they are rendered useless by cavities. And so, a special unit—the dragon dentists—has the important duty of caring for the dragon's teeth.\n\nNonoko Kishii was the only one of many brave volunteers who survived a recent round of recruitment; in order to join the dragon dentists, one has to witness their future demise and accept it without a fight. Knowing the exact circumstances of their fated ends, the dragon dentists devote themselves to their work. One day, they gain a new member who did not undergo the test: Bernard \"Bel\" Octavius, a young enemy officer killed by his own men and revived by the dragon's teeth. Despite his appearance being an omen of a great disaster, he is placed under the care of Nonoko as a dentist-in-training. Will Bel come around to the dragon dentists' attitudes toward death and help them face the painful future that is to come?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ryuu no Haisha is based off the first episode of Nihon Animator Mihonichi, a collaborative weekly OVA series of standalone anime shorts.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":715,"type":"anime","name":"Dwango","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/715/Dwango"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Khara","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/47/Khara"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33983,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33983/Onihei","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1330/133826l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"AnQTjc3hlII","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQTjc3hlII","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnQTjc3hlII?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AnQTjc3hlII/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AnQTjc3hlII/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AnQTjc3hlII/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AnQTjc3hlII/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AnQTjc3hlII/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Onihei"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"鬼平"},{"type":"English","title":"Onihei"}],"title":"Onihei","title_english":"Onihei","title_japanese":"鬼平","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":1,"year":2017},"to":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2017}},"string":"Jan 10, 2017 to Apr 4, 2017"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.3,"scored_by":14719,"rank":2626,"popularity":3406,"members":39885,"favorites":105,"synopsis":"The blade arts of the \"Devil\" tasked with striking down evils threatening a peaceful Edo!

Three mighty walls—Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena—provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose—but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets of their own members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 adapts content from volumes 9-12 of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga.","season":"spring","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1499,"type":"anime","name":"Techno Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1499/Techno_Sound"},{"mal_id":1557,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":858,"type":"anime","name":"Wit Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":33486,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33486/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85221l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"ayeDDe8eN1E","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayeDDe8eN1E","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayeDDe8eN1E?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ayeDDe8eN1E/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ayeDDe8eN1E/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ayeDDe8eN1E/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ayeDDe8eN1E/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ayeDDe8eN1E/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"僕のヒーローアカデミア"},{"type":"English","title":"My Hero Academia Season 2"},{"type":"German","title":"My Hero Academia – 2.

Willem awakens 500 years later, only to find himself the sole survivor of his race as mankind is wiped out.\n \nTogether with the other surviving races, Willem takes refuge on the floating islands in the sky, living in fear of the Beasts below. He lives a life of loneliness and only does odd jobs to get by. One day, he is tasked with being a weapon storehouse caretaker. Thinking nothing of it, Willem accepts, but he soon realizes that these weapons are actually a group of young Leprechauns. Though they bear every resemblance to humans, they have no regard for their own lives, identifying themselves as mere weapons of war. Among them is Chtholly Nota Seniorious, who is more than willing to sacrifice herself if it means defeating the Beasts and ensuring peace.\n \nWillem becomes something of a father figure for the young Leprechauns, watching over them fondly and supporting them in any way he can. He, who once fought so bravely on the frontlines, can now only hope that the ones being sent to battle return safely from the monsters that destroyed his kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1651,"type":"anime","name":"Production Ace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1651/Production_Ace"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Satelight","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"},{"mal_id":605,"type":"anime","name":"C2C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/605/C2C"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33475,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33475/Busou_Shoujo_Machiavellianism","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83995l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Ghi2R6-HcMA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghi2R6-HcMA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghi2R6-HcMA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ghi2R6-HcMA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ghi2R6-HcMA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ghi2R6-HcMA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ghi2R6-HcMA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ghi2R6-HcMA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"武装少女マキャヴェリズム"},{"type":"English","title":"Armed Girl's Machiavellism"},{"type":"German","title":"Armed Girl's Machiavellism"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Armed Girl's Machiavellism"},{"type":"French","title":"Armed Girl's Machiavellism"}],"title":"Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism","title_english":"Armed Girl's Machiavellism","title_japanese":"武装少女マキャヴェリズム","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2017},"to":{"day":21,"month":6,"year":2017}},"string":"Apr 5, 2017 to Jun 21, 2017"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.89,"scored_by":202011,"rank":4609,"popularity":598,"members":374709,"favorites":994,"synopsis":"The Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy was originally a high school for high-class girls.

Claiming that she will die if he doesn't kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri's pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji's name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm.

For the eldest, Yaichirou, who aims to become the next Trick Magister and leader of the tanuki society, it starts with reinstating the popular shogi tournament. For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family’s factory. But for the third son, Yasaburou, it simply means embracing the \"fool's blood\" he inherited from his father and living a carefree but interesting life. This, of course, includes hunting for the mysterious and elusive snake-like creature known as a tsuchinoko, and causing ripples of trouble at every turn.\n\nHowever, these ripples threaten to turn into waves with the return of Nidaime, the estranged son of the brothers' tengu teacher, Professor Akadama. Nidaime bears a grudge against not only his father, but his father's apprentice Benten as well. His loyalties suddenly brought into question, Yasaburou must use his tanuki wit to appease all sides without getting caught in the crossfire, before the delicate balance between human, tengu, and tanuki is overthrown and all hell breaks loose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":1261,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"},{"mal_id":1334,"type":"anime","name":"Docomo Anime Store","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

Due to allegedly attracting merfolk and subsequently causing the death of the elder's mother, music is seldom discussed in the Ashimoto household. Even so, Kai finds solace in making looped beats on his laptop and uploading them to the internet.\n\nDespite his reserved and glum demeanor, Kai is approached by Kunio and Yuuho Ebina, two cheerful classmates that happened upon one of his videos. The pair ask him to join their rock band but are met with apathy. Nevertheless, Kai agrees to accompany them in a practice session on Merfolk Island, where he soon witnesses something that he cannot explain.\n\nLater that night, Kai is composing music in his room when he attracts a familiar entity—a mermaid. As she twirls and grins to the sound of his stereo, Kai discovers a number of aspects about the being who introduces herself as Lu: she possesses incredible water manipulation powers; she buds a pair of functioning legs with the sound of music; but most notably, she is a truly benevolent creature who simply wants people to like her. Fostering a dynamic friendship, Kai and Lu gradually come to express their genuine selves, testing the long-standing boundaries that have deafened the resounding harmony among the people of Hinashi Town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"In 2017, Yoake Tsugeru Lu no Uta became the first Japanese production in over 22 years to win the \"Cristal for a Feature Film\" award at the 27th Annecy International Animation Film Festival.

As the school's annual graduation performance titled \"Shadow and Lights\" quickly approaches, the second-years in the Musical Department must participate in the production as part of their curriculum. Out of the 25 students in the division, five of them will receive a training role and actively participate as actors in the program alongside the graduating class. Attaining one of these coveted spots will not only increase a student's academic standing within the department, but it will also put them in the running for a position on the elite Kao Council.\n\nWhile every student in the department strives to obtain one of the five training roles, Team Yuzuriha's Riku Ageha is practically a front-runner for the role of Alexis' Shadow.

Working alongside him are the aloof Pepu and the gaming-obsessed Chiku, though the value of their membership remains somewhat questionable. With his two henchmen by his side, the crew's inexperienced leader sets his sights on their first target: Earth.\n\nAccording to the manuals, Earth should be a simple enough target, but the situation spirals out of control right from the start.

He says that mushrooms are appearing on tossed away items that as they are born from the feelings of sadness, and they emit a negative energy that effects both humans and Cocotama. Cocotama can get rid of them but not without the acorn and not at the speed humans are currently discarding items at.\n\nTepple uses the acorn to take a Happy Star but inadvertently causes a rift of darkness and an infestation of mushrooms in Cocotama World. And Happy Stars begin spilling out into the human world draining all magic out.

Since many of the students are the children of the richest people in the world, the academy has its quirks that separate it from all the others. By day, it is a normal school, educating its pupils in history, languages, and the like. But at night, it turns into a gambling den, educating them in the art of dealing with money and manipulating people. Money is power; those who come out on top in the games stand at the top of the school.\n\nYumeko Jabami, a seemingly naive and beautiful transfer student, is ready to try her hand at Hyakkaou's special curriculum. Unlike the rest, she doesn't play to win, but for the thrill of the gamble, and her borderline insane way of gambling might just bring too many new cards to the table.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1039,"type":"anime","name":"DIVE II Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1039/DIVE_II_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1185,"type":"anime","name":"81 Produce","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1185/81_Produce"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":59,"type":"anime","name":"High Stakes Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/59/High_Stakes_Game"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":34599,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/86733l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"AQbaZeby2zA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQbaZeby2zA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQbaZeby2zA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQbaZeby2zA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQbaZeby2zA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQbaZeby2zA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQbaZeby2zA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQbaZeby2zA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Made in Abyss"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"メイドインアビス"},{"type":"English","title":"Made in Abyss"}],"title":"Made in Abyss","title_english":"Made in Abyss","title_japanese":"メイドインアビス","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":7,"year":2017},"to":{"day":29,"month":9,"year":2017}},"string":"Jul 7, 2017 to Sep 29, 2017"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.66,"scored_by":721902,"rank":67,"popularity":93,"members":1332868,"favorites":43060,"synopsis":"The Abyss—a gaping chasm stretching down into the depths of the earth, filled with mysterious creatures and relics from a time long past.

Only the last master-servant pair standing may claim the Grail for themselves. Yet, the third war ended inconclusively, as the Grail mysteriously disappeared following the conflict.\n\nMany years later, the magi clan Yggdmillennia announces its possession of the Holy Grail, and intends to leave the Mage's Association. In response, the Association sends 50 elite magi to retrieve the Grail; however, all but one are killed by an unknown servant. The lone survivor is used as a messenger to convey Yggdmillennia's declaration of war on the Association.\n\nAs there are only two parties involved in the conflict, the Holy Grail War takes on an unusual form. Yggdmillennia and the Mage's Association will each deploy seven master-servant pairs, and the side that loses all its combatants first will forfeit the artifact.

Curiosity gets the better of her and she follows it into nearby woods. Deep in the forest, the cat takes her to a clearing with dead trees and brown grass, where the only sign of life is a cluster of mysterious blue flowers that Mary has never seen before. The gardener of the estate later tells her that the rare species is called \"Fly-by-Night,\" and is said to be sought by witches for its incredible magical power.\n\nWhen the strange cat returns to her one night, Mary is led once again into the woods, but this time to an old broomstick hidden by a gnarled tree. After she clumsily squashes some Fly-by-Night against the broomstick, it begins to glow, whisking her off into the sky. Her wayward journey ends at the Endor College for Witches, where she is mistaken for a new student.

However, while her peers have family to attend, Koyuki has no one, as her only family—her brother—died years ago. While visiting his grave, she meets two brothers named Kiri and Victor Putin chasing a strange creature. They try to assure her that they are just actors shooting a movie; Victor, however, piques Koyuki's curiosity about the old legend of the clock tower at the cemetery: if you make a wish under the clock tower at midnight during a full moon, time will turn back, allowing someone to reclaim what they have lost.\n\nDeciding to make her wish, Koyuki learns the horrifying truth: the legend is a ruse for time demons called \"Horologues\" to steal humans' time. As they are drawn to regrets, Victor uses Koyuki as bait to lure a demon there.

When he activates the program, an odd woman appears and tries to drag him to her realm. Luckily, a mysterious, white-haired girl severs their connection and helps him escape, revealing that the woman is a witch; however, their conversation is cut short. As Haruto enters the realm again, he meets an anthropomorphic, talking cat named Katsumi Kanzaki. While the witch's minions pursue them, the white-haired girl opens a door for them to escape.\n\nAfter their ordeal, Haruto describes their savior—which only he can see—and Katsumi, the leading authority on dream world research, realizes that she must be \"Lily,\" a being that resurfaces repeatedly across multiple dreamscapes. Hoping to leave the dream world through a blue door, they enter the witch's realm once again. Finding themselves in peril, Lily reveals the truth to Haruto: witches suffer from \"Sleeping Beauty Syndrome,\" a coma-like sleep state induced by torment in their real world lives. Thus, they cannot wake until they are defeated in the dream world.\n\nAfter finally defeating the witch and locating the blue door, Haruto and Katsumi say their farewells, promising to meet up in the real world. However, when Haruto exits through the door, he awakens in the dream world bedroom once more. Seeking answers, Haruto and Katsumi try to uncover the mysteries of the witches, Lily, and Haruto's own inability to leave the dream world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"18if is a part of a multi-media project that also includes a mobile game and a virtual reality game.","season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":276,"type":"anime","name":"DLE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/276/DLE"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1213,"type":"anime","name":"Mobcast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1213/Mobcast"},{"mal_id":1581,"type":"anime","name":"RAY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1581/RAY"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":34777,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34777/91_Days__Toki_no_Asase_Subete_no_Kinou_Ashita_Mata_Ashita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1692/132999l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"uq2R9HBpKLI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq2R9HBpKLI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uq2R9HBpKLI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uq2R9HBpKLI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uq2R9HBpKLI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uq2R9HBpKLI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uq2R9HBpKLI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uq2R9HBpKLI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"91 Days: Toki no Asase/Subete no Kinou/Ashita, Mata Ashita"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"91 Days Episode 13"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"91 Days Special"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"91Days Day13「時の浅瀬／すべての昨日／明日、また明日」"},{"type":"English","title":"91 Days: Shoal of Time/All Our Yesterdays/Tomorrow and Tomorrow"},{"type":"German","title":"91 Days: Folge 13 Untiefen der Zeit/Alle gestrigen Tage/ Morgen und wieder Morgen"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"91 Days Episodio 13 – El Bajío del Tiempo / Todo nuestro Ayer / Mañana y mañana"},{"type":"French","title":"91 Days Episode 13"}],"title":"91 Days: Toki no Asase/Subete no Kinou/Ashita, Mata Ashita","title_english":"91 Days: Shoal of Time/All Our Yesterdays/Tomorrow and Tomorrow","title_japanese":"91Days Day13「時の浅瀬／すべての昨日／明日、また明日」","title_synonyms":["91 Days Episode 13","91 Days Special"],"type":"Special","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2017},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 5, 2017"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.89,"scored_by":28714,"rank":4601,"popularity":2876,"members":54335,"favorites":31,"synopsis":"1.

But a group of mountain bandits shows up and makes fun of the pirates. “Why didn't you fight them?!” Luffy yells out angrily but Shanks says that it's nothing worth getting mad over. At that time, Luffy snatches the Gum-Gum Fruit from a treasure box and eats it and as a result, his entire body becomes rubber and he loses the ability to swim for the rest of his life! A few days later, Luffy is surrounded by the mountain bandits again and Shanks comes to help. “No matter what the reason, anyone who hurts my friends has to pay!!” Shanks and his pirate crew are incredibly strong and they beat down the mountain bandits.

Using powerful, ancient armor known as Symphogear, Hibiki and her teammates work with the United Nations to deal with international disputes and disasters.  \n\nDuring a mission briefing at headquarters, Hibiki is made aware of a mysterious organization known as the Bavarian Illuminati, who has been responsible for several major disasters in the past and currently operate in the war-torn country Val Verde. Together, Hibiki and her team infiltrate one of the Bavarian Illuminati's manufacturing plants and free hundreds of slaves. Exposed, alchemists Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, and Prelati reveal themselves as the organization's top brass, and—using alchemical powers—declare a global revolution while sacrificing thousands of lives. Faced with yet another threat to the world's survival, Hibiki and her allies must confront the Bavarian Illuminati in their most difficult and destructive battle yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":647,"type":"anime","name":"Memory-Tech","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/647/Memory-Tech"},{"mal_id":775,"type":"anime","name":"Bushiroad","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"},{"mal_id":963,"type":"anime","name":"MAGES.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"},{"mal_id":1679,"type":"anime","name":"Kinyosha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1679/Kinyosha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Satelight","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":60,"type":"anime","name":"Idols (Female)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":35658,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35658/Kuroko_no_Basket__Last_Game_NG-shuu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86001l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kuroko no Basket: Last Game NG-shuu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"黒子のバスケ LAST GAME NG集"}],"title":"Kuroko no Basket: Last Game NG-shuu","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"黒子のバスケ LAST GAME NG集","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Special","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2017},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 27, 2017"},"duration":"2 min","rating":"PG-13 -

However, the class president Han Seonho often shows Myeongyi kindness and understanding. With his friendly gestures and handsome looks, he becomes Myeongyi's first crush.\n\nNine years later, Myeongyi attends his high school reunion for only one reason: to see Han Seonho once again. He holds a tiny glimmer of hope about the other man's feelings for him—but after seeing the bright gold ring on Seonho's left hand and listening to their classmates' prying questions, that hope is quickly dashed. Excusing himself to go take a smoke, regardless of the state of his lungs, Myeongyi is followed outside by Seonho. Unexpectedly, that marks the beginning of their illicit love affair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2807,"type":"anime","name":"ABJ COMPANY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2807/ABJ_COMPANY"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":49,"type":"anime","name":"Erotica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/49/Erotica"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33184,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33184/Battle_Girl_High_School","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87837l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"DFP_qQGGMTU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFP_qQGGMTU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFP_qQGGMTU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DFP_qQGGMTU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DFP_qQGGMTU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DFP_qQGGMTU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DFP_qQGGMTU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DFP_qQGGMTU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Battle Girl High School"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Battle Girl Project"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"バトルガール ハイスクール"},{"type":"English","title":"Battle Girl High School"}],"title":"Battle Girl High School","title_english":"Battle Girl High School","title_japanese":"バトルガール ハイスクール","title_synonyms":["Battle Girl Project"],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2017},"to":{"day":18,"month":9,"year":2017}},"string":"Jul 3, 2017 to Sep 18, 2017"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.8,"scored_by":6050,"rank":10153,"popularity":4347,"members":24101,"favorites":43,"synopsis":"Based on COLOPL's school action role-playing game.

Children can become Stone Leaders by having one of these creatures as a \"pet\" which they can do friendly battles with against others.","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":34755,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34755/Kuma_no_Gakkou__Patissier_Jackie_to_Ohisama_no_Sweets","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83800l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"OtUUHikvQLI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtUUHikvQLI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtUUHikvQLI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtUUHikvQLI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtUUHikvQLI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtUUHikvQLI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtUUHikvQLI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtUUHikvQLI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kuma no Gakkou: Patissier Jackie to Ohisama no Sweets"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Eiga Kuma no Gakkou: Patissier Jackie to Ohisama no Sweets"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"映画くまのがっこう パティシエ・ジャッキーとおひさまのスイーツ"}],"title":"Kuma no Gakkou: Patissier Jackie to Ohisama no Sweets","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"映画くまのがっこう パティシエ・ジャッキーとおひさまのスイーツ","title_synonyms":["Eiga Kuma no Gakkou: Patissier Jackie to Ohisama no Sweets"],"type":"Movie","source":"Picture book","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":8,"year":2017},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 25, 2017"},"duration":"30 min","rating":"G -

Raised together as children, they came to know of the \"Wizard King\"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.\n\nWhen they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a \"Black Clover\" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty.

Meanwhile, second-year student Ena Komiya seeks to revive the photography club to its former glory, refusing to let the organization be disbanded.

Now, he spearheads the operation aimed at reclaiming humanity's birthright from the king of monsters and slaying him once and for all. But, alongside humanity, Earth has undergone drastic change since their departure; Godzilla and its numerous spawns may pale in comparison to the darkness lurking within the hearts of this close-knit community of survivors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1023,"type":"anime","name":"Polygon Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1023/Polygon_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":36198,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36198/Omiai_Aite_wa_Oshiego_Tsuyoki_na_Mondaiji","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/88326l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Omiai Aite wa Oshiego, Tsuyoki na, Mondaiji."},{"type":"Synonym","title":"My Marriage Partner is My Student"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"a Cocky Troublemaker"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"My Marriage Interview Partner is a Student"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Strong"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"and a Problem Child"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"お見合い相手は教え子、強気な、問題児。"},{"type":"English","title":"My Matchmaking Partner Is My Student, An Aggressive Troublemaker"}],"title":"Omiai Aite wa Oshiego, Tsuyoki na, Mondaiji.","title_english":"My Matchmaking Partner Is My Student, An Aggressive Troublemaker","title_japanese":"お見合い相手は教え子、強気な、問題児。","title_synonyms":["My Marriage Partner is My Student","a Cocky Troublemaker","My Marriage Interview Partner is a Student","Strong","and a Problem Child"],"type":"ONA","source":"Web manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":10,"year":2017},"to":{"day":18,"month":12,"year":2017}},"string":"Oct 2, 2017 to Dec 18, 2017"},"duration":"4 min per ep","rating":"Rx - Hentai","score":5.64,"scored_by":21405,"rank":null,"popularity":2736,"members":59519,"favorites":152,"synopsis":"Teacher Nano Saikawa hasn't given much thought to marriage, but her father's friend wants her to have a marriage interview with his son, Souichirou Takamiya.

It is about the injury of rigid religious upbringing to a teenager who discovers the strange and terrifying reality behind fundamentalism. Warped into an ultra-religious environment from a young age, his surroundings force him to adhere to a rigid and sometimes irrational world-view. He eventually succumbs to the madness, and lives consumed by guilt while devouring every crumb of false hope thrown at him from his religious community. One day he gathers the courage to leave his faith behind, and sees that human existence is actually a more nuanced experience than the black and white reality in which he grew up in. By using metaphors of signs and symbols, the animation highlights and describes the mental illness caused by the conservative church on the lead character and illustrates how the character makes his way out from his dire situation.\n\n(Source: IMDB)","background":"Runner-up of Best Animated Short Film at the 54th Golden Horse Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":49121,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49121/Kkum-ui_Wang-gug_SofyRuby","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1842/115554l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kkum-ui Wang-gug SofyRuby"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Sophie Ruby Season 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SofyRuby Season 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"꿈의 왕국 소피 루비"},{"type":"English","title":"Dream Kingdom SofyRuby"}],"title":"Kkum-ui Wang-gug SofyRuby","title_english":"Dream Kingdom SofyRuby","title_japanese":"꿈의 왕국 소피 루비","title_synonyms":["Sophie Ruby Season 2","SofyRuby Season 2"],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":10,"year":2017},"to":{"day":3,"month":11,"year":2018}},"string":"Oct 21, 2017 to Nov 3, 2018"},"duration":"12 min per ep","rating":"G -
