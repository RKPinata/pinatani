The robot leads Nobita on many adventures, and while Nobita's life certainly is more exciting with the robot cat from the future, it is questionable if it is in fact better in the way that Doraemon planned.\n\n(Source: AniDB)\n\nNote: The series has been poorly preserved, and never released on any format, nor has it ever been re-aired. \n\nNearly all the footage within the series (except for the opening and closing credits) was destroyed in an accidental fire sometime after the series was cancelled.\n\nSurviving reels from the show are occasionally shown at Doraemon fan conventions in Japan. In addition, the audio of several episodes still survives. Still images from episodes 1 and 24 exists.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1973,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"},{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":4597,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4597/Kouya_no_Shounen_Isamu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/54387l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"xx-Oq5Mcuvk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx-Oq5Mcuvk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xx-Oq5Mcuvk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xx-Oq5Mcuvk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xx-Oq5Mcuvk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xx-Oq5Mcuvk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xx-Oq5Mcuvk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xx-Oq5Mcuvk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kouya no Shounen Isamu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Willie Boy"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Willy Boy"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shounen Isamu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Rough and Ready Cowboy"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Isamu the Wilderness Boy."},{"type":"Japanese","title":"荒野の少年イサム"}],"title":"Kouya no Shounen Isamu","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"荒野の少年イサム","title_synonyms":["Willie Boy","Willy Boy","Shounen Isamu","The Rough and Ready Cowboy","Isamu the Wilderness Boy."],"type":"TV","source":"Unknown","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1973-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1974-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":1973},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":1974}},"string":"Apr 4, 1973 to Mar 27, 1974"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"G -
