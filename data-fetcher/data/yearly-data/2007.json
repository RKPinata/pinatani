In the face of growing tensions to claim the dragon orb, Hakufu and Gentoku will have to put aside their differences and work together to thwart Moutoku's demonic plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ikkitousen: Dragon Destiny was released on DVD by Media Blasters from November 24, 2009 to September 14, 2010.","season":"winter","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"10:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 10:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":882,"type":"anime","name":"Toranoana","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/882/Toranoana"},{"mal_id":1636,"type":"anime","name":"Gigno Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1636/Gigno_Systems"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":1852,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1852/Hidamari_Sketch","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1893/133786l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hidamari Sketch"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ひだまりスケッチ"},{"type":"English","title":"Hidamari Sketch"}],"title":"Hidamari Sketch","title_english":"Hidamari Sketch","title_japanese":"ひだまりスケッチ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":1,"year":2007},"to":{"day":30,"month":3,"year":2007}},"string":"Jan 12, 2007 to Mar 30, 2007"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.46,"scored_by":26364,"rank":1949,"popularity":2337,"members":78186,"favorites":1063,"synopsis":"Ever since she was young, Yuno has always had an interest in art.

Among his remains were notes and artifacts that needed to be identified by the family near a notable triangular mountain in Japan known as \"Japan's pyramid\", a place suspected by some to be man-made. A meteor containing a strange robotic lifeform falls from the sky and begins to cause destruction, putting Saiga in danger and causing a mysterious bracelet from his father's research to activate and merge him with an ancient robot burried within the pyramid—a robot the runes describe as Reideen. It is now up to Saiga and guardian Reideen to fight against this unknown alien threat from the sky.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1865,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1865/Getsumen_To_Heiki_Mina","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1865l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Getsumen To Heiki Mina"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Getsumen Usagi Heiki Miina"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Lunar Bunny Weapon Mina"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Getsumen To Heiki Miina"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"月面兎兵器ミーナ"}],"title":"Getsumen To Heiki Mina","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"月面兎兵器ミーナ","title_synonyms":["Getsumen Usagi Heiki Miina","Lunar Bunny Weapon Mina","Getsumen To Heiki Miina"],"type":"TV","source":"Other","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":14,"month":1,"year":2007},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2007}},"string":"Jan 14, 2007 to Mar 25, 2007"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.29,"scored_by":2252,"rank":7808,"popularity":6727,"members":8217,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"An animated spin-off from the Densha Otoko (Trainman) TV drama.\n\nIn the drama, actor Itoh Atsushi plays the otaku Yamada, whose main love in life is the Mina anime, a cutesy busty heroine with floppy rabbit ears and carrots sticking out her rear.\n\nMina itself is a character homage which triggers back to the Daicon Animation done by GAINAX where a similar nameless bunny girl appeared.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"OB Planning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/67/OB_Planning"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":1914,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1914/Saiunkoku_Monogatari_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73277l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Saiunkoku Monogatari 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Saiunmono"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Saimono"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Saiunkoku Monogatari Dai 2 Series"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"彩雲国物語 第2シリーズ"},{"type":"English","title":"Tales of Saiunkoku"}],"title":"Saiunkoku Monogatari 2nd Season","title_english":"Tales of Saiunkoku","title_japanese":"彩雲国物語 第2シリーズ","title_synonyms":["Saiunmono","Saimono","Saiunkoku Monogatari Dai 2 Series"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":39,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":4,"year":2007},"to":{"day":8,"month":3,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 7, 2007 to Mar 8, 2008"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.02,"scored_by":17798,"rank":585,"popularity":3374,"members":40557,"favorites":198,"synopsis":"Shuurei Kou and her friend Eigetsu To, a boy prodigy of humble origins, have been appointed co-governors of the Sa province, one of the eight provinces in Saiunkoku.

Which is why when teenage Haruka Amami auditions for something called the Idolmaster Project, she THINKS she's trying out to be a singing idol. Instead, Haruka finds herself at a secret school run by the Mondenkind Agency, living with a group of other girls who have also been selected as candidates to pilot an iDOL - an advanced robot specifically designed to intercept falling chunks of moon rock. Except, the people who run the Mondenkind Agency aren't exactly knights in shining armor. And then there's the question of whether the iDOLs are really JUST robots. Because from almost the first moment, Haruka starts to feel emotions resonating from within the iDOL called Imber. \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"02:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 02:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2155,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2155/Kono_Aozora_ni_Yakusoku_wo__Youkoso_Tsugumi_Ryou_e","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75248l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku wo: Youkoso Tsugumi Ryou e"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"この青空に約束を― ～ようこそつぐみ寮へ～"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku wo"}],"title":"Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku wo: Youkoso Tsugumi Ryou e","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"この青空に約束を― ～ようこそつぐみ寮へ～","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Visual novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2007},"to":{"day":27,"month":6,"year":2007}},"string":"Apr 4, 2007 to Jun 27, 2007"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.16,"scored_by":6237,"rank":8443,"popularity":4587,"members":21171,"favorites":21,"synopsis":"One morning, Wataru Hoshino found a sleeping girl—in nothing but her underwear—in his room.

There's a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real —if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel— and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":141,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/141/Toei_Video"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":4444,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4444/Zero_Duel_Masters","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/124274l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Zero Duel Masters"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ゼロ デュエル・マスターズ"}],"title":"Zero Duel Masters","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ゼロ デュエル・マスターズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":4,"year":2007},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2007}},"string":"Apr 9, 2007 to Sep 28, 2007"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":5.95,"scored_by":961,"rank":9546,"popularity":10009,"members":2664,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"It is featured in an alternate universe where Shobu had lost his duel against Hakuoh in their duel back in the Season 1 episode \"Just Duel It\".\n\nA mysterious organization is interested in fledgling duelist Shobu Kirifuda's ability to bring Duel Master creatures to life.

At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.\n\nBased on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Baccano! is based on Ryohgo Narita's award-winning light novels of the same title and mainly adapts the first 4 novels. While more faithful to the first 3 novels, the 4th novel (1932) is followed more loosely and is mostly an anime-exclusive story. In addition, content from later novels is briefly included in the anime as well. Unlike the novels however, which follow a mostly linear narrative per book, the anime adopts a non-linear storytelling style; the tale of each novel is told simultaneously with one another, with the focus jumping back and forth in time between and within the different plotlines.","season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/765/Sakura_Create"},{"mal_id":787,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/787/Happinet_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2476,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2476/School_Days","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1593/122440l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"School Days"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スクールデイズ"},{"type":"English","title":"School Days"}],"title":"School Days","title_english":"School Days","title_japanese":"スクールデイズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Visual novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2007-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2007-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":7,"year":2007},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2007}},"string":"Jul 4, 2007 to Sep 27, 2007"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":5.52,"scored_by":392387,"rank":11305,"popularity":301,"members":654045,"favorites":3253,"synopsis":"High school student Makoto Itou first notices Kotonoha Katsura at the start of his second semester, freshman year. Immediately, he becomes entranced by her beauty, but his bashfulness doesn't allow him to approach her, even though they ride the same train every day. Instead, he snaps a photo of her in secret and sets it as his cell phone's wallpaper: a charm that, if kept under wraps, would supposedly help you realize your love.

By the year 2050, Japan has firmly established itself as the leader in robotic technology and manufacture with Daiwa Heavy Industries. As the technology evolves to include robotic enhancements to the human body, the blurring of the line between man and machine triggers a sudden shift in world opinion. In response, the U.N. passes a unilateral ban of further research and development on robotics in 2067. Japan fiercely objects to this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdrew from international politics and chose to pursue a policy of high-tech national isolation. While only trade continues, Japan disappears from the world scene.\n\nTen years later, a series of bizarre incidents lead the American technology police agency SWORD to believe that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies through the use of the RACE network. SWORD dispatches a unit of special agents to infiltrate Japan and gather intelligence on the country. Vexille, a veteran agent among the group, uncovers the horrifying truth behind the ten years of isolation.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":795,"type":"anime","name":"Yahoo!

Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.\n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.\n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them?

And then, Mai's class mates started to make fun of Mai and draw a funny portrait of Dai-Chan on black board in the class. Mai gets shocked and hurt at that mischief. And moreover, their mother gets sickness at the same time. That's why Dai-Chan should enter in an orphanage for handicapped children; however, Mai really wants to take care of him by herself, so she tries to stop it. \n\nThis story is written about a love of family, close bond, and relationship between human and human.

But within the walls of her detective agency lies the secret to her prolific crime-solving skills: the cases are actually solved by her assistant, Neuro Nougami.\n\nHowever, to call Neuro an ordinary man would be incorrect. In reality, he is a demon, who came to the human world in search of the ultimate mystery, having already solved every mystery in the demon world. With Yako as his proxy, he feasts on the negative energy released by humans when they commit crimes. Thus, he promises to help Yako solve the mystery of her father's death. But to do so, he must avoid drawing too much attention to himself, which is why Yako plays the role of the detective.
