After a deadly virus threatened the extinction of mankind, a new race called the Enterrans was created to preserve life on Earth. However, relations between the Enterrans and their creators did not remain peaceful. Soon a war broke out with the Enterrans fighting against the humans and their robots. Ultimately the Enterrans were the victors of this conflict, renaming Earth as Enterra in honor of their victory.\n\nBefore the last vestiges of humanity fell, one of the few remaining scientists put his daughter, Yakumo Shindou, into a sleep chamber. His hope was that his daughter would one day reawaken and find the human sanctuary known as Shinzo, reviving humanity and restoring peace between humans and Enterrans. Centuries have passed since the war; Yakumo now awakens and meets an Enterran named Mashura who pledges to assist in her quest. Also joined by the Enterrans Sago and Kutal, the group must now work to locate Yakumo's missing memories and locate Shinzo. But not every Enterran is as kind as Yakumo's new friends and some are prepared to commit any atrocity to prevent the return of humanity.","background":"Mushrambo was based on the famous 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West, but adapted to a futuristic science fiction setting.

While staying with his grandfather, the owner of a game shop, he comes across an ancient Egyption relic known as the \"Millennium Puzzle.\" Rumored to grant any wish to those who solve the Puzzle, Yuugi becomes determined to solve it to wish for some friends. After years of struggling, Yuugi manages to complete the puzzle and mysteriously finds that his wish has been fulfilled.\n\nMeanwhile, a new card game known as \"Duel Monsters\" starts rising in popularity. In this game, players called duelists fight against each other with \"monsters\" by using magic and trap cards to foil their opponent's plans. Yuugi quickly becomes skilled at the game and lives a peaceful life with his newfound friends.\n\nHowever, Yuugi's peace is short-lived. The undefeated duelist and egocentric billionaire Seto Kaiba suddenly abducts Yuugi's grandfather, forcing him to duel against the rare \"Blue Eyes White Dragon'' card. Yuugi is thrown into a new world of fierce battles and the stakes continue to rise as dark forces interfere from the shadows. After unexpectedly defeating Kaiba with the help of his \"other self\"—the spirit of a nameless pharaoh—contained in the puzzle, he unofficially becomes the top duelist known as \"The King of Games.\" However, this new title will attract covetousness and Yuugi will have to use all his intelligence and willpower in order to protect what he holds the dearest to him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Yu☆Gi☆Oh!

But the robe was stolen and the man who had stolen it forced her to become his wife, thus producing a family full of human and tennyo blood mixed.\n\nNow, in modern day time, Aya Mikage is a descendent of Ceres, and has quite an amount of tennyo blood. On her 16th birthday, she and her twin brother, Aki, are thrown a party. At the \"party,\" Aya's grandpa plans to kill her, for she has tennyo powers unlike the rest of the family, and can actually become Ceres herself and destroy the Mikage family. Aya, however, can switch back, so this transformation happens quite frequently.\n\nWith protector Yuuhi by her side, it is up to Aya to control Ceres and keep her from coming back, but her relationship with an ex-worker for her evil grandpa may be a distraction.","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2000,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Reincarnation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":1363,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1363/Detective_Conan_Movie_04__Captured_in_Her_Eyes","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1196/94319l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Detective Conan Movie 04: Captured in Her Eyes"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Meitantei Conan: Hitomi no Naka no Ansatsusha"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Detective Conan Movie 4"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"瞳の中の暗殺者"},{"type":"English","title":"Case Closed Movie 4: Captured In Her Eyes"},{"type":"German","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 4: Der Killer in ihren Augen"},{"type":"French","title":"Detektiv Conan Film 4: L'assassins dans Ses Yeux"}],"title":"Detective Conan Movie 04: Captured in Her Eyes","title_english":"Case Closed Movie 4: Captured In Her Eyes","title_japanese":"瞳の中の暗殺者","title_synonyms":["Meitantei Conan: Hitomi no Naka no Ansatsusha","Detective Conan Movie 4"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2000-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":22,"month":4,"year":2000},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 22, 2000"},"duration":"1 hr 40 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.03,"scored_by":36619,"rank":572,"popularity":2702,"members":61079,"favorites":94,"synopsis":"On a rainy afternoon, the Detective Boys witness a murder across the street.

She will portray a princess who struggles to respond to the love confession of the neighboring country's prince.

However, she is repeatedly distracted by a presence reminiscent of a Clow Card as well as unexplained disappearances around town.\n\nEventually, Sakura learns of another of Clow Reed's creations—the \"Nothing\"—which was formerly sealed away beneath the magician's old house. It has power equal to all 52 cards Sakura possesses, and furthermore, it wants to take those cards away from her! Objects, space, and people disappear from Tomoeda with each card that is stolen. Sakura sets out to capture the Nothing so everything will return to normal, but what must she sacrifice in the process?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: Fuuin Sareta Card earned a total of 522 million yen during its original theatrical run in Japan.
