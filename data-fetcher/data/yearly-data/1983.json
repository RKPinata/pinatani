Fortunately, they are rescued by some marine creatures. \n\nDoraemon and his friends are later captured by these creatures, revealed to be inhabinats of the underwater kingdom of Mu. It is revealed that another undersea kingdom, Atlantis, now controlled by robots, was about to destroy the Earth with nuclear weapons after mistaking a volcano eruption for an invasion. \n\nWith the help of a young boy from Mu, Nobita and his friends attempt to stop the robots, but are all captured. However, when things are at their grimmest, Doraemon's robotic underwater vehicle sacrifices itself to destroy the computer that controlled all the robots and nuclear weapons. \n\nAfter returning to Mu, Doraemon and his friends are hailed as heroes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2231,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2231/Miyuki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/50245l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Miyuki"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"みゆき"}],"title":"Miyuki","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"みゆき","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":37,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1983-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1984-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":1983},"to":{"day":20,"month":4,"year":1984}},"string":"Mar 31, 1983 to Apr 20, 1984"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.65,"scored_by":1003,"rank":5783,"popularity":8697,"members":4243,"favorites":10,"synopsis":"Wakamatsu Masato lives with his step-sister, Miyuki, whom he does not have blood relationship with.
