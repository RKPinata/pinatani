A large sprout begins to grow, and it turns into a tree which then bears a lot of fruit. Watching Kanisuke, Sarukichi notices that the father crab is having difficulty picking persimmons, so he picks a basket-full of the fruit and runs away. When Sarukichi sees Kanisuke following him, he throws persimmon at Kanisuke and kills him. In order to avenge his father's death, the child crab Kanitaro consults with his three uncles, Kurisaku (chestnut), Hachinosuke (bee), and Usubei (mortar). The three promise him to help him. The three uncles enter Sarukichi's house while he is away, where Usubei climbs up on the roof, Hachinosuke stays outside the house, and Kurisaku hides himself behind a folding screen. When Sarukichi returns home, he is surprised by the bursting of chestnuts Kurisaku threw in the fireplace and they have a sword fight. Hachinosuke joins the fight with his spear. When Sarukichi runs out of the house, Usubei falls on his head, and Kanitaro cuts off his nose. Hanging Sarukichi from the spear, the three uncles and Kanitaro return triumphantly.\n\n(Source: animation.filmarchives.jp)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":43329,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/43329/Da_Nao_Hua_Shi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Da Nao Hua Shi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Uproar in the Studio"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Studio Scene"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"大鬧畫室"}],"title":"Da Nao Hua Shi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"大鬧畫室","title_synonyms":["Uproar in the Studio","Studio Scene"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1927-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":5,"year":1927},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 1927"},"duration":"10 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":16116,"popularity":19745,"members":184,"favorites":0,"synopsis":null,"background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]}],"summer":[],"fall":[{"mal_id":35492,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35492/Tako_no_Hone","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1541/90555l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tako no Hone"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"蛸の骨"},{"type":"English","title":"The Octopus Bone"}],"title":"Tako no Hone","title_english":"The Octopus Bone","title_japanese":"蛸の骨","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Other","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1927-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":11,"year":1927},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 2, 1927"},"duration":"8 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":4.79,"scored_by":458,"rank":12762,"popularity":13332,"members":899,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Based on the Urashima Taro tale, the story is about how the Octopus lost its skeleton. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]}]}}
