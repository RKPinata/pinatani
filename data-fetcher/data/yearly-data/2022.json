While Noé is grateful to Chloé for her hospitality, little does he know that she might be siding with forces far more dangerous than the Beast itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1554,"type":"anime","name":"Contents Seed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":41946,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41946/Shuumatsu_no_Harem","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/117296l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"lre7UaVnLk8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lre7UaVnLk8","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lre7UaVnLk8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lre7UaVnLk8/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lre7UaVnLk8/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lre7UaVnLk8/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lre7UaVnLk8/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lre7UaVnLk8/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shuumatsu no Harem"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"終末のハーレム"},{"type":"English","title":"World's End Harem"}],"title":"Shuumatsu no Harem","title_english":"World's End Harem","title_japanese":"終末のハーレム","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":2022},"to":{"day":18,"month":3,"year":2022}},"string":"Jan 7, 2022 to Mar 18, 2022"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":5.93,"scored_by":95023,"rank":null,"popularity":935,"members":248900,"favorites":1967,"synopsis":"Reito Mizuhara is a medical student at the National Advanced Medical School in Tokyo who contracts a rare, lethal disease called cellular sclerosis.

Equipped with a crest specializing in creation, a man named Gaius reached the ceiling of his potential, becoming known as the world's strongest sage. Despite his overwhelming power, he is unsatisfied with his abilities and desires to possess the mark suitable for close combat. Knowing that a person's crest is unchangeable, Gaius decides to reincarnate far into the future, hoping to alter his fate.\n\nThousands of years later, Gaius is reborn as Mathias Hildesheimer, successfully obtaining his long-coveted crest. However, he is surprised to learn that in these times, magic has vastly waned, and the techniques that were once widely used are now nothing more than just a speck of legend. Moreover, the crest that he painstakingly strived to attain is now considered the weakest—merely dubbed the \"Crest of Failure.\"\n\nNevertheless, Mathias naturally exceeds all expectations.

Sasaki saves Miyano's classmate from a group of bullies, and after that, Miyano cannot seem to shake off his eccentric upperclassman. His silent admiration for Sasaki gradually sours into annoyance each time the so-called delinquent refuses to leave him alone. Constantly being called by cute nicknames and having his boundaries ignored, Miyano wonders why Sasaki wants to get close to him.\n\nThe shy and easily flustered Miyano harbors an embarrassing secret—he is a \"fudanshi,\" a boy who likes boys' love (BL) manga. The last thing he wants is for other students to find out, but through a slip of the tongue, he reveals the truth to Sasaki. Intrigued, the clueless Sasaki asks to borrow a book to read, which he is given very reluctantly. To Miyano's surprise, Sasaki enjoys the BL that he receives and asks for more, marking a shift in their strange dynamic.\n\nAlthough Sasaki appears to possess some personal agenda, his feelings for Miyano become complicated the more time they spend together. As they now share a common interest, their relationship is poised to change and further develop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1294,"type":"anime","name":"Sound Team Don Juan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1294/Sound_Team_Don_Juan"},{"mal_id":1355,"type":"anime","name":"TV Aichi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1355/TV_Aichi"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1583,"type":"anime","name":"U-NEXT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1583/U-NEXT"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":49721,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49721/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san_3","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/120361l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"N238ads-bdw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N238ads-bdw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N238ads-bdw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/N238ads-bdw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/N238ads-bdw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/N238ads-bdw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/N238ads-bdw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/N238ads-bdw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Skilled Teaser Takagi-san 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Third Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"からかい上手の高木さん3"},{"type":"English","title":"Teasing Master Takagi-san 3"}],"title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3","title_english":"Teasing Master Takagi-san 3","title_japanese":"からかい上手の高木さん3","title_synonyms":["Skilled Teaser Takagi-san 3rd Season","Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Third Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2022},"to":{"day":26,"month":3,"year":2022}},"string":"Jan 8, 2022 to Mar 26, 2022"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.42,"scored_by":78610,"rank":166,"popularity":1286,"members":178212,"favorites":2304,"synopsis":"As summer break comes to an end, Nishikata is stoked to try out his newest pranks and finally outdo his classmate Takagi once and for all.

However, the sheer ingenuity may be just enough to gain the attention of the citizens and regain his reputation as an architect. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":951,"type":"anime","name":"NAZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/951/NAZ"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":42808,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42808/Shenmue_the_Animation","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1427/120586l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"3k3bu2mE9Mw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3bu2mE9Mw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3k3bu2mE9Mw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3k3bu2mE9Mw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3k3bu2mE9Mw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3k3bu2mE9Mw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3k3bu2mE9Mw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3k3bu2mE9Mw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shenmue the Animation"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"シェンムー"}],"title":"Shenmue the Animation","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"シェンムー","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Game","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":2,"year":2022},"to":{"day":1,"month":5,"year":2022}},"string":"Feb 6, 2022 to May 1, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.67,"scored_by":6834,"rank":5703,"popularity":4578,"members":21247,"favorites":155,"synopsis":"1985, Yokosuka.

The realm of deities sent a spirit seed down into the world to help the common people. But the spirit seed continuously absorbed the evil of the world and cruelly harmed living things. In the end, Sen Luo, the king of the deities, sacrificed himself and sealed it.

In spite of their plots, renowned spy and master of disguise \"Twilight\" fulfills dangerous missions one after another in the hope that no child will have to experience the horrors of war.\n\nIn the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons the alias of \"Loid Forger,\" an esteemed psychiatrist. However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on prominent politician Donovan Desmond, who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the curious six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his master plan. He will enroll Anya in Eden Academy, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him the opportunity to meet Donovan without arousing suspicion. \n\nUnfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has trouble playing the figure of a loving father and husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor—who is an underground assassin known as \"Thorn Princess\"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's minds—have no plans to disclose their own secrets either. Although this picture-perfect family is founded on deception, the Forgers gradually come to understand that the love they share for one another trumps all else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the Anime of the Year (TV Series) at the 2023 Tokyo Anime Award Festival (TAAF).","season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":858,"type":"anime","name":"Wit Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"},{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":43608,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/43608/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Ultra_Romantic","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1160/122627l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"vFN5K-iAyV0","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFN5K-iAyV0","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFN5K-iAyV0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/vFN5K-iAyV0/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3rd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"かぐや様は告らせたい-ウルトラロマンティック-"},{"type":"English","title":"Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic"}],"title":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic","title_english":"Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic","title_japanese":"かぐや様は告らせたい-ウルトラロマンティック-","title_synonyms":["Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 3rd Season","Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3rd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":4,"year":2022},"to":{"day":25,"month":6,"year":2022}},"string":"Apr 9, 2022 to Jun 25, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":9.03,"scored_by":484567,"rank":10,"popularity":187,"members":870086,"favorites":30210,"synopsis":"The elite members of Shuchiin Academy's student council continue their competitive day-to-day antics.

Determined to uncover its mysteries, he sets off toward the source, but he falls into the waters below.\n\nA strange girl, whom he later nicknames Uta, saves him. But little does Hibiki know that Uta's appearance in his life will reveal the secrets behind the disastrous event that changed their world forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Bubble received an early screening at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2022.

The two scientists soon find that their feelings for each other are nothing compared to that of a mature couple. It is here that Chris poses a question to both Yukimura and Himuro: what will they do if their \"affection\" is proven not to be love after all?\n\nDesperate to find a scientific rationale for the discrepancy, Yukimura puts everything on the line to prove that their \"love\" is real.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":874,"type":"anime","name":"Flex Comix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/874/Flex_Comix"},{"mal_id":1221,"type":"anime","name":"Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1221/Hokkaido_Cultural_Broadcasting"},{"mal_id":1300,"type":"anime","name":"Office Nobu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1300/Office_Nobu"},{"mal_id":1414,"type":"anime","name":"bilibili","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1677,"type":"anime","name":"Kanetsu Investment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment"},{"mal_id":1985,"type":"anime","name":"Toyo Recording","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1985/Toyo_Recording"},{"mal_id":2095,"type":"anime","name":"Global Solutions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2095/Global_Solutions"},{"mal_id":2108,"type":"anime","name":"SUPA LOVE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2108/SUPA_LOVE"},{"mal_id":2144,"type":"anime","name":"BloomZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2144/BloomZ"},{"mal_id":2186,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai-Kojo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2186/Mirai-Kojo"},{"mal_id":2221,"type":"anime","name":"AMG Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2221/AMG_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":2233,"type":"anime","name":"Starry Cube","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2233/Starry_Cube"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":48903,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48903/Dragon_Ball_Super__Super_Hero","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1501/122797l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"EwXiAhcSv2o","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwXiAhcSv2o","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwXiAhcSv2o?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwXiAhcSv2o/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwXiAhcSv2o/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwXiAhcSv2o/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwXiAhcSv2o/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwXiAhcSv2o/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dragon Ball Super Movie 2: Superhero"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ドラゴンボール超スーパーヒーロー"},{"type":"English","title":"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"}],"title":"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero","title_english":"Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero","title_japanese":"ドラゴンボール超スーパーヒーロー","title_synonyms":["Dragon Ball Super Movie 2: Superhero"],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":6,"year":2022},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 11, 2022"},"duration":"1 hr 39 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.56,"scored_by":52936,"rank":1562,"popularity":2044,"members":96831,"favorites":564,"synopsis":"Years after his father is defeated by an adolescent Gokuu Son, Magenta seeks revenge against Gokuu's family and allies.

He finally decides to return after hearing that his father—owner of the Kyoto sweets store Ryokushou—has been hospitalized. Worrying that no one would inherit the shop if his father passes away, Nagomu prepares himself to embrace his family's legacy and the art of making sweets⁠.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nagomu discovers that his father has already chosen a different successor—a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira, who was abandoned at Ryokushou by her father for reasons unknown. While she has since become a part of the family and is now the shop's poster girl, Itsuka still longs to see her father and follows all possible clues that may lead her to him. Sympathizing with Itsuka's situation, Nagomu's mother asks Nagomu to act as Itsuka's father, hoping that Itsuka will open up to him and relieve her pain, even if just a little.\n\nStarting on bad terms, Itsuka and Nagomu gradually learn more about each other, realizing that they are more similar than they had thought. Connected by their mutual love for both Ryokushou and its confections, their relationship as child and father figure begins to make lives around them a little bit sweeter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Deaimon was released on Blu-ray and DVD on August 24, 2022.","season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2308,"type":"anime","name":"Midorimatsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2308/Midorimatsu"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":354,"type":"anime","name":"Encourage Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/354/Encourage_Films"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":48702,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48702/Dance_Dance_Danseur","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1571/121381l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"BJyYs7W0KHU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJyYs7W0KHU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJyYs7W0KHU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJyYs7W0KHU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJyYs7W0KHU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJyYs7W0KHU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJyYs7W0KHU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJyYs7W0KHU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dance Dance Danseur"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ダンス・ダンス・ダンスール"},{"type":"English","title":"Dance Dance Danseur"}],"title":"Dance Dance Danseur","title_english":"Dance Dance Danseur","title_japanese":"ダンス・ダンス・ダンスール","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":4,"year":2022},"to":{"day":18,"month":6,"year":2022}},"string":"Apr 9, 2022 to Jun 18, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.86,"scored_by":31779,"rank":830,"popularity":2291,"members":80614,"favorites":639,"synopsis":"Junpei Murao's love affair with ballet began at a young age during his sister's ballet recital, when a male ballet dancer roused his interest with a gripping performance.

That is why he is in the soccer club, trains Jeet Kune Do, and is intent on following in his father's footsteps of becoming a stunt coordinator: all very \"manly\" activities.\n\nWhen Junpei's classmate Miyako Godai spots him demonstrating an impressive kick that combines skills from ballet and Jeet Kune Do to his friends, she suddenly recruits him to join her mother's ballet studio. He resists at first, and although he has abandoned his dreams of formally pursuing ballet, nothing quite captures the euphoria that ballet elicits. After suppressing his desire to pursue ballet for so long, it is not so easy to shake off his hesitation and break free of the shackles of masculinity.

As their population grew at an astounding rate, they promptly threw humanity off its place at the top of the food chain. Desperate to avoid extinction, the surviving humans concentrated in their last safe haven—a small city surrounded by an enormous wall. There, they have waged war against the vampires for many years. \n\nIn the midst of a particularly brutal attack by the vampires, a human soldier named Momo encounters Fiine, the queen of their enemies. After seeing her try to save Momo's best friend from a rampaging vampire, Momo follows Fiine back to her house.

The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei Lü continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people—but Lü is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, Lü slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Kingdom 4th Season was released on Blu-ray in three volumes from August 26, 2022 to November 25, 2022.","season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1797,"type":"anime","name":"NHK Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"},{"mal_id":1998,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Signpost","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1998/Studio_Signpost"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":50338,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50338/Kunoichi_Tsubaki_no_Mune_no_Uchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1724/121343l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"rzWfn5k5cDk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzWfn5k5cDk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzWfn5k5cDk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rzWfn5k5cDk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rzWfn5k5cDk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rzWfn5k5cDk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rzWfn5k5cDk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/rzWfn5k5cDk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Inside Tsubaki Kunoichi's Heart"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"くノ一ツバキの胸の内"},{"type":"English","title":"In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki"}],"title":"Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi","title_english":"In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki","title_japanese":"くノ一ツバキの胸の内","title_synonyms":["Inside Tsubaki Kunoichi's Heart"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":4,"year":2022},"to":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2022}},"string":"Apr 10, 2022 to Jul 3, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.16,"scored_by":21662,"rank":3343,"popularity":2802,"members":57311,"favorites":295,"synopsis":"Tsubaki hails from an all-female clan of ninjas hidden deep in the forest.

As luck would have it, a dark elf healer named Karla approaches and asks if Alvin requires assistance—being seemingly oblivious to the situation before her eyes.

Takagi survived and the situation was settled, but in Sato's eyes, the image of the grim reaper that she had seen when Jinpei Matsuda, the man she had been in love with, had been killed in a series of bombings three years ago, overlapped with Takagi's.\n\nAt the same time, the perpetrator of the bombings escapes from prison. Rei Furuya/Toru Amuro, a member of the public safety police, is hunting down the man who killed his classmate, but a mysterious person in disguise suddenly appears and puts a collar bomb on him.\n\nConan visits the underground shelter where Amuro is hiding out to disarm the collar bomb, and hears about an incident three years ago when he and his now deceased classmates from the police academy encountered an unidentified virtual bomber named \"Plamya\" in Shibuya. As Conan and his team investigate, a disturbing shadow begins to loom over them.\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":50678,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50678/Kyoukai_Senki_Part_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1968/122304l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"5xDE0u4wt9U","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xDE0u4wt9U","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xDE0u4wt9U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5xDE0u4wt9U/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5xDE0u4wt9U/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5xDE0u4wt9U/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5xDE0u4wt9U/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5xDE0u4wt9U/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kyoukai Senki Part 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"境界戦機"},{"type":"English","title":"AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2"}],"title":"Kyoukai Senki Part 2","title_english":"AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2","title_japanese":"境界戦機","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":4,"year":2022},"to":{"day":28,"month":6,"year":2022}},"string":"Apr 12, 2022 to Jun 28, 2022"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

Tourism and immigration are heavily controlled—if not impossible. Each region is overseen by an AI moderator that maintains its domain as it sees fit. These clusters are refined into a single ideal, with every citizen fulfilling their role in preserving the moderator's creation. But not everyone is satisfied with the narrowly focused vision of the city they were born in, and thus, they require some under-the-table help in relocating to a more appropriate cluster.\n\nDuring the day, Equa, Ferres, and Martese are ordinary high school students; but at night, they act as Extractors—people who illegally smuggle civilians between the city borders. Transporting those brave enough to leave everything behind, Equa and her friends risk their lives in order to give their clients a second chance. But the dangers of extraction begin to intensify when the cluster moderators become increasingly aware of the group's actions that threaten their perfect utopias.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Estab-Life: Great Escape is an anime adaptation that is a part of the Estab-Life multimedia project created by Gorou Taniguchi.

As a teenager living in the city's slums, David Martinez is trying to fulfill his mother's lifelong wish for him to reach the top of Arasaka, the world's leading security corporation. To this end, he attends the prestigious Arasaka Academy while his mother works tirelessly to keep their family afloat.\n\nWhen an incident with a street gang leaves David's life in tatters, he stumbles upon Sandevistan cyberware—a prosthetic that grants its wearer superhuman speed. Fueled by rage, David implants the device in his back, using it to exact revenge on one of his tormentors. This gets him expelled from the academy, shattering his hopes of ever making his mother proud.\n\nAfter witnessing David's newfound abilities, the beautiful data thief Lucyna \"Lucy\" Kushinada offers to team up with him, handing him a ticket to salvation.

Despite the challenges she faces in this ambitious endeavor, Haru wants everyone in the world to love idols, even willing to become the shining guidepost—shine post—to accomplish her dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shine Post is an anime adaptation that is a part of the multimedia project of the same name by Konami Digital Entertainment and Straight Edge.","season":"summer","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1334,"type":"anime","name":"Docomo Anime Store","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"},{"mal_id":1470,"type":"anime","name":"Konami Digital Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1470/Konami_Digital_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1554,"type":"anime","name":"Contents Seed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":1683,"type":"anime","name":"Straight Edge","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1683/Straight_Edge"},{"mal_id":2017,"type":"anime","name":"Culture Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2017/Culture_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":2062,"type":"anime","name":"Stray Cats","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2062/Stray_Cats"},{"mal_id":2118,"type":"anime","name":"ADK Emotions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2118/ADK_Emotions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1997,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1997/Studio_Kai"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":60,"type":"anime","name":"Idols (Female)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":50470,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50470/Kami_Kuzu☆Idol","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124088l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"yWxSZCS7cM4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWxSZCS7cM4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWxSZCS7cM4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/yWxSZCS7cM4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/yWxSZCS7cM4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/yWxSZCS7cM4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/yWxSZCS7cM4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/yWxSZCS7cM4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kami Kuzu☆Idol"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kami Kuzu Idol"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"神クズ☆アイドル"},{"type":"English","title":"Phantom of the Idol"}],"title":"Kami Kuzu☆Idol","title_english":"Phantom of the Idol","title_japanese":"神クズ☆アイドル","title_synonyms":["Kami Kuzu Idol"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":10,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":7,"year":2022},"to":{"day":3,"month":9,"year":2022}},"string":"Jul 2, 2022 to Sep 3, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.74,"scored_by":7444,"rank":5312,"popularity":4475,"members":22380,"favorites":48,"synopsis":"Kazuki Yoshino and Yuuya Niyodo are idols who make up the duo ZINGS.

However, as soon as one of them utters the word \"hell,\" more creatures show up until there are 12 in total. The sisters think nothing of this until the critters create a portal that summons an envoy from Hell.\n\nJabberwock the Eighth, a horned and fanged man covered in fur, has come to unleash a living hell on earth under orders from his boss. However, when living in the human realm proves to be challenging, the Onigami sisters allow him to stay with them. They also take in his \"Chimimoryo spirits\"—the round demons that preceded his arrival. Called Jigoku-san by the Onigami sisters, this messenger from Hell has a lot of work cut out for him if he wants to take over the world. But before that, he will have to survive the everyday hells of human life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Chimimo was released on Blu-ray and DVD in two volumes from December 7, 2022 to January 18, 2023.","season":"summer","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1330,"type":"anime","name":"ensky","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1330/ensky"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1390,"type":"anime","name":"Toy's Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1390/Toys_Factory"},{"mal_id":1800,"type":"anime","name":"Marui Group","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1800/Marui_Group"},{"mal_id":2118,"type":"anime","name":"ADK Emotions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2118/ADK_Emotions"},{"mal_id":2185,"type":"anime","name":"BS Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2185/BS_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2575,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2575/TV_Tokyo_Communications"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52252,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52252/Delivery_Chiko_wo_Tanomitai_Oneesan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1647/124859l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Delivery Chi*ko wo Tanomitai Oneesan"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"デリバリーち〇こを頼みたい お姉さん"}],"title":"Delivery Chi*ko wo Tanomitai Oneesan","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"デリバリーち〇こを頼みたい お姉さん","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":2022},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 30, 2022"},"duration":"26 min","rating":"Rx -

Although he has a father with peerless kung fu and a mother who is the daughter of the head of the Wen family, he is not good at martial arts and prefers to brew wine. Ten years later, the best wine can be brewed. Finally, he stole a land deed from his home and ran hundreds of miles to Chaisang City to open a wine shop. But a long street is already full of evil stars. Only he is really a young boy who is serious about making wine. Because of this, he was inexplicably involved in the disputes between the two families.

His only companion is his pet, the chainsaw devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for money that inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji can do is dream of a good, simple life: one with delicious food and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy betrayal by the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death, crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness.\n\nRemarkably, an old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to transform his body parts into chainsaws. Because Denji's new abilities pose a significant risk to society, the Public Safety Bureau's elite devil hunter Makima takes him in, letting him live as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the promise of a content life alongside an attractive woman, Denji devotes everything and fights with all his might to make his naive dreams a reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Chainsaw Man was released in four volumes on Blu-ray and DVD from January 27, 2023 to April 28, 2023.","season":"fall","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":50602,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50602/Spy_x_Family_Part_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/127508l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"WFVY88Urzuc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFVY88Urzuc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFVY88Urzuc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WFVY88Urzuc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WFVY88Urzuc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WFVY88Urzuc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WFVY88Urzuc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WFVY88Urzuc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Spy x Family Part 2"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"SPY×FAMILY"}],"title":"Spy x Family Part 2","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"SPY×FAMILY","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":10,"year":2022},"to":{"day":24,"month":12,"year":2022}},"string":"Oct 1, 2022 to Dec 24, 2022"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.29,"scored_by":422047,"rank":265,"popularity":204,"members":834199,"favorites":7177,"synopsis":"With Anya Forger successfully enrolled at the renowned Eden Academy, Operation Strix advances to its second phase.

So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night.

But as the conflict with the Nokkers only leads to more loss, Fushi must find the inner strength to face his inevitable sorrow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Fumetsu no Anata e 2nd Season was released in two volumes on Blu-ray and DVD from April 26, 2023 to July 26, 2023.","season":"fall","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1797,"type":"anime","name":"NHK Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1967,"type":"anime","name":"Drive","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1967/Drive"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":49891,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49891/Tensei_shitara_Ken_deshita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/127909l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"TDN4Rh7VvkU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDN4Rh7VvkU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDN4Rh7VvkU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TDN4Rh7VvkU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TDN4Rh7VvkU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TDN4Rh7VvkU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TDN4Rh7VvkU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TDN4Rh7VvkU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tensei shitara Ken deshita"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I became the sword by transmigrating"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"TenKen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"転生したら剣でした"},{"type":"English","title":"Reincarnated as a Sword"}],"title":"Tensei shitara Ken deshita","title_english":"Reincarnated as a Sword","title_japanese":"転生したら剣でした","title_synonyms":["I became the sword by transmigrating","TenKen"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2022-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":10,"year":2022},"to":{"day":21,"month":12,"year":2022}},"string":"Oct 5, 2022 to Dec 21, 2022"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.54,"scored_by":120605,"rank":1658,"popularity":938,"members":248600,"favorites":1548,"synopsis":"A nameless sword wakes up to discover he has been reincarnated from his former life as a human.

Calling themselves Reunion, the rebel faction mercilessly destroys cities, further contributing to the already calamitous nature of Catastrophes.\n\nRhodes Island, committed to treating the infected and uninfected as equals, is a paramilitary pharmaceutical organization believed to be the most advanced in its research for the Oripathy cure. Unfortunately, the person spearheading the project—an enigmatic figure known only as the Doctor—suffers from amnesia, effectively impeding what might be the only hope for the infected to break free from their chains of despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Arknights: Reimei Zensou adapts the Hour of An Awakening main story arc of Hypergryph's 2019 mobile game Arknights.

Residing in her jet-black palace and isolated from the emperor, she is the subject of countless rumors. Claimed to possess mystic abilities, she is said to take on any request—from finding lost items to inflicting curses. While some call her an immortal sage, others believe her to be a terrifying revenant. But such comments fail to faze Jusetsu, who prefers to spend her days in quiet solitude. That is, until the emperor, Ka Koushun, barges into her court and asks for her assistance with a mysterious case.\n\nThe young emperor's request requires Jusetsu to step out of her palace for the first time. Despite Ka Koushun's frequent visits annoying her to no end, she cannot bring herself to turn him away.

This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":44141,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/44141/Watashi_ni_Tenshi_ga_Maiorita_Precious_Friends","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1267/124382l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"40SI4hlkFts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SI4hlkFts","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/40SI4hlkFts?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/40SI4hlkFts/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/40SI4hlkFts/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/40SI4hlkFts/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/40SI4hlkFts/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/40SI4hlkFts/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!
