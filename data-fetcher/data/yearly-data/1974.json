Not only is Takeshi the son of the International Police Department Chief but in times of peril and danger, mild-mannered Takeshi uses his trusty Poly-Met (Polymer Helmet) to transform into the Superhero “Hurricane” Polymer, a red suited masked man with incredible fighting abilities and superhuman strength. The only one who knows Takeshi’s secret is his lazy Saint Bernard, Daisaku, who always likes to provide cutting commentary to the audience (using his inner voice). \n\nTogether Jo and Takeshi (as Polymer) confront and battle a myriad of evil organizations, criminal gangs, mutants and monsters as they fight crime in the future city of Washinkyo (Washington/Tokyo).\n\n(Source: japanhero.com)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1974,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6397,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6397/Tentoumushi_no_Uta","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/51187l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tentoumushi no Uta"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Song of Tentomushi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tentou Mushi no Uta"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"てんとう虫の歌"},{"type":"English","title":"Song of the Ladybug"}],"title":"Tentoumushi no Uta","title_english":"Song of the Ladybug","title_japanese":"てんとう虫の歌","title_synonyms":["The Song of Tentomushi","Tentou Mushi no Uta"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":104,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1974-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1976-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":1974},"to":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":1976}},"string":"Oct 6, 1974 to Sep 26, 1976"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G -
