In order to do so, Gorou must first conquer the ranks of the Minor League, where numerous skilled players compete in the grueling rise to the Majors.\n\nGorou learns that he will have to adapt to the stark differences of American culture and push himself to new extremes as his race to join the Major League begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":118,"type":"anime","name":"SynergySP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/118/SynergySP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":3841,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3841/Chis_Sweet_Home","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/7632l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Chi's Sweet Home"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Chii's Sweet Home"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Chiizu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"チーズスイートホーム"},{"type":"French","title":"Chi une vie de chat"}],"title":"Chi's Sweet Home","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"チーズスイートホーム","title_synonyms":["Chii's Sweet Home","Chiizu"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":104,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":31,"month":3,"year":2008},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2008}},"string":"Mar 31, 2008 to Sep 25, 2008"},"duration":"3 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.67,"scored_by":26906,"rank":1257,"popularity":2636,"members":63794,"favorites":433,"synopsis":"One day, a small kitten named Chi is found by a young boy named Youhei and his mother.

Yes, the ever troublesome pollen allergy season has come to defile its victims once more, but it's not their noses that are being blown.\n \nThrough the miracles of evolution, the reproductive process of plants no longer yield the tiny yellow grains that stimulate the nose. Instead, they now produce beautiful girls and boys that float joyfully through the air, stimulating other areas of the body instead, whether willing or not. Moans of ecstasy and frenzy reverberate across the world from those desperate to seek relief from their relief.\n \nAlthough the streets run white with bodily fluids, people are far from relieved of their sexual troubles; fortunately, it is the perfect time to search for solutions! Inspiration can be found around every corner as encounters with the pollinic beings expose both hidden feelings and alluring physicality. Regardless of the climax that each person reaches, one thing is for sure—no amount of tissues will be enough for this allergy season.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":405,"type":"anime","name":"T-Rex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/405/T-Rex"},{"mal_id":2333,"type":"anime","name":"Space-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2333/Space-X"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3887,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3887/Ookiku_Furikabutte__Kihon_no_Kihon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1588/108620l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ookiku Furikabutte: Kihon no Kihon"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ookiku Furikabutte - The Basics of Basics"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Oofuri"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ohkiku Furikabutte"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Swing Big!"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"おおきく振りかぶって 基本のキホン"},{"type":"English","title":"Big Windup!

This leads them to seek help from the four monarchs of Palmier's neighboring  countries. \n\nNot to make things too easy, dark forces are afoot once again. An evil organization, Eternal, is keen on adding the Rose Pact to its ever-growing collection of treasures. To make matters worse, the director of this dastardly museum seems to have a vested interest in the Cure Rose Garden. \n\nFortunately, a new story brings with it new allies. Enter Syrup, the courier boy with a bad attitude. His desire to reach the Garden is pure, but who exactly is he?

At a loss without their revolutionary leader, Area 11's resistance group—the Black Knights—find themselves too powerless to combat the brutality inflicted upon the Elevens by Britannia, which has increased significantly in order to crush any hope of a future revolt. \n\nLelouch Lamperouge, having lost all memory of his double life, is living peacefully alongside his friends as a high school student at Ashford Academy. His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started, in this thrilling conclusion to the series.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is an original anime series by Sunrise animation studio with original character designs by the all-female Japanese manga artist group CLAMP.

Yet Kotoko remains optimistic that, because she now lives in his house, her unattainable crush on the genius since the beginning of high school has never been more within reach.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Episode 25 was first aired back-to-back with episode 24 on CBC TV on September 25th, prior to its first airing on TBS (September 27th).","season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"02:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 02:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":643,"type":"anime","name":"Trinity Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/643/Trinity_Sound"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":3092,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3092/Junjou_Romantica","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8811l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"7GSmjrg0rC0","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GSmjrg0rC0","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GSmjrg0rC0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7GSmjrg0rC0/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7GSmjrg0rC0/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7GSmjrg0rC0/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7GSmjrg0rC0/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7GSmjrg0rC0/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Junjou Romantica"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Junjyou Romantica"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Junjou Romantica: Pure Romance"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"純情ロマンチカ"},{"type":"English","title":"Junjo Romantica"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Junjo Romantica"}],"title":"Junjou Romantica","title_english":"Junjo Romantica","title_japanese":"純情ロマンチカ","title_synonyms":["Junjyou Romantica","Junjou Romantica: Pure Romance"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":27,"month":6,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 11, 2008 to Jun 27, 2008"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.49,"scored_by":143300,"rank":1842,"popularity":929,"members":251285,"favorites":4426,"synopsis":"High school student Misaki Takahashi returns home to see his older brother being fondled by an unknown man.

After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld residents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity and the woman he once knew.\n\nThrough a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, Kaiba weaves together tales of souls and spirits and explores the importance of memories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The series received an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2008 Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":33,"type":"anime","name":"WOWOW","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3572,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3572/Macross_F","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/15648l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Macross F"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"マクロスF（フロンティア）"},{"type":"English","title":"Macross Frontier"}],"title":"Macross F","title_english":"Macross Frontier","title_japanese":"マクロスF（フロンティア）","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":25,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":26,"month":9,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 4, 2008 to Sep 26, 2008"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.89,"scored_by":66454,"rank":777,"popularity":1510,"members":145276,"favorites":1871,"synopsis":"Following a catastrophic war against a race of giants known as the Zentradi, humanity has escaped towards the center of the galaxy aboard a fleet of colonial vessels called the Macross Frontier.

But to make things more complicated, he also lacks a crucial fact—what is the real threat against Murasaki?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"02:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 02:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":213,"type":"anime","name":"Half H.P Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3407,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3407/Blassreiter","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/133811l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"9KzeDJ072Wc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KzeDJ072Wc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KzeDJ072Wc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9KzeDJ072Wc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9KzeDJ072Wc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9KzeDJ072Wc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9KzeDJ072Wc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9KzeDJ072Wc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Blassreiter"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"BLASSREITER -genetic-"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ブラスレイター"},{"type":"English","title":"Blassreiter"}],"title":"Blassreiter","title_english":"Blassreiter","title_japanese":"ブラスレイター","title_synonyms":["BLASSREITER -genetic-"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 6, 2008 to Sep 28, 2008"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":6.89,"scored_by":29388,"rank":4607,"popularity":2265,"members":81935,"favorites":217,"synopsis":"Modern Germany is plagued by an outbreak of \"Amalgams.\" Existing solely to wreak havoc, these cybernetic entities spawn from rotting flesh and can fuse with technology to gain new abilities.

As a response, regional governments established the Library Defense Force (LDF), whose members take up arms and put their lives on the line to protect freedom of expression. At the top of the Kanto branch of the LDF stands the Library Task Force (LTF): an elite squad consisting of only the most exceptional fighters.\n\nAs a high schooler, Iku Kasahara experienced the terror of censorship first-hand when she refused to surrender the newest volume of her favorite series to MBC agents. She only came out unscathed thanks to a lone member of the LDF, who protected her and her beloved book. Now in her 20s and still unable to forget the man who saved her, Kasahara joins the LDF in the hope of becoming just like her prince.\n\nBut LDF training turns out to be far more rigorous than she could have imagined, and her instructor, LTF member Atsushi Doujou, seems fixated on making her life a living hell. Given her struggles, Kasahara is shocked when she is selected as one of the two new LTF recruits as a result of Doujou's recommendation. As Kasahara does all she can to become worthy of the LTF and unravel her enigmatic superior's motivations, she wages war—both on the battlefield and in her personal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":325,"type":"anime","name":"Code","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/325/Code"},{"mal_id":517,"type":"anime","name":"Asmik Ace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/517/Asmik_Ace"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1175,"type":"anime","name":"Atelier Musa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1175/Atelier_Musa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":12079,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12079/Black★Rock_Shooter","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/54331l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Black★Rock Shooter"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"BRS"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Supercell: Black Rock Shooter"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hatsune Miku's Black★Rock Shooter"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ブラック★ロックシューター"}],"title":"Black★Rock Shooter","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ブラック★ロックシューター","title_synonyms":["BRS","Supercell: Black Rock Shooter","Hatsune Miku's Black★Rock Shooter"],"type":"Music","source":"Other","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":13,"month":6,"year":2008},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jun 13, 2008"},"duration":"4 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.04,"scored_by":33426,"rank":null,"popularity":2545,"members":67980,"favorites":312,"synopsis":"The official music video that eventually spawned the entire Black Rock Shooter franchise.

The anime has shonen-ai themes which are completely absent from the manga.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"02:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 02:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":490,"type":"anime","name":"Maiden Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":3359,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3359/Amatsuki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/75555l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"jm3Xm1cgVUc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm3Xm1cgVUc","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm3Xm1cgVUc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jm3Xm1cgVUc/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jm3Xm1cgVUc/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jm3Xm1cgVUc/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jm3Xm1cgVUc/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jm3Xm1cgVUc/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Amatsuki"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あまつき"},{"type":"English","title":"Amatsuki"}],"title":"Amatsuki","title_english":"Amatsuki","title_japanese":"あまつき","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":28,"month":6,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 5, 2008 to Jun 28, 2008"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.88,"scored_by":26024,"rank":4618,"popularity":2797,"members":57347,"favorites":123,"synopsis":"Tokidoki Rikugou is a history-hating student who flunks out of his Japanese History course; his high school forces him to make up for his failed grade by attending a special museum lecture.

Quickly dismissing the existence of gods and demons, he is shocked when confronted by a demon on a bridge, who attacks the unsuspecting high-schooler.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:59","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:59 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1791,"type":"anime","name":"D.N.

Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n1. \"The Third Wish” (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \"Amelie\". But it's no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \"yellow brick road\" (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city.\n\n2. \"Ajukari” (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \"complex\" can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \"manly\" and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths.\n\n3. \"Baby\" (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \"I'm not saying you can't have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\" asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \"Tazza: The High Rollers\" and hilarious episodes where an \"ambulance bus\" picks up several patients en route.\n\n4. \"Shine Shine Shining\" (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids.\n\n5. \"Merry Golasmas\" is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas ― one who's black, another who's Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair ― lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian.\n\n6. “Lies\" explores homosexuality. Drawn in pastel-like sketches with art deco-esque details, it is a stunning digital cut-out animation, A homosexual man is forced by his parents to marry a woman, while others are pressured to fake having a girlfriend or receive \"therapy\" to become straight.\n\n(Source: The Korean Times)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4417,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4417/Hennako-chan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/8379l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hennako-chan"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hen na Ko chan"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"へんな子ちゃん"}],"title":"Hennako-chan","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"へんな子ちゃん","title_synonyms":["Hen na Ko chan"],"type":"ONA","source":"Unknown","episodes":6,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":25,"month":4,"year":2008},"to":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2008}},"string":"Apr 25, 2008 to Jul 3, 2008"},"duration":"3 min per ep","rating":null,"score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":17111,"popularity":17130,"members":349,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"Hennako-chan is a black comedy series targeted at adult readers.

It was meant to be the \"making-of\" extra of Watashi no Coffee Samurai but is an early pilot with a different story (the idea of a mechanized girl and transforming guy vs. a mechanized transforming guy and normal girl). Director Jang Hyeong-yoon stewed on this early creation for over half a decade before the original idea was re-worked again into a feature film Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso.\n\nIn the special, the girl is mechanized and fights kaijuu with her giant flying bird.

After getting stuck in a glass jar, she drifts to the shore where she is freed by Sousuke, a five-year-old boy who lives with his mother Lisa in a house by the sea while his father Koichi works on a fishing boat. After healing a cut on Sousuke's finger by licking it, the goldfish is named Ponyo by her new friend.\n\nUnknown to Sousuke, Ponyo already has a name and a family. Her father Fujimoto, a sorcerer who forsook his humanity to live underwater, searches frantically for his daughter Brunhilde. When found and captured, Ponyo rejects her birth name and declares that she wants to become a human. Using the power received from Sousuke's blood, she grows arms and legs and escapes to the surface once more. But the magic released into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, causing the Moon to start falling out of orbit and the tides to grow dangerously stronger. Reunited with Ponyo, Sousuke must pass an ancient test to restore order in the world and let his companion live on as a human.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Gake no Ue no Ponyo—Miyazaki's 8th animated film with Studio Ghibli—grossed more than $201 million USD worldwide. It is made up of over 170,000 individual frames. In 2009, the film won in five categories at the 8th Annual Tokyo Anime awards. It was also awarded with the 32nd Japan Academy Prize for both Animation of the Year and Outstanding Musical Achievement. Many aspects of Ponyo drew from portions of day-to-day life. The seaside village, for example, is based on Tomonoura, Japan, with some sections inspired by Richard Wagner’s Die Walküre.

Passed around from one foster home to another, he was left isolated and lonely. Over time, he has accepted that no one would ever believe him and has closed himself off to his current caretakers and classmates.\n\nWhen Natsume accidentally breaks an intangible barrier, he frees Madara—a mighty spirit in the form of a lucky cat. Madara notices that Natsume bears a remarkable resemblance to his late grandmother Reiko Natsume, an outcast girl who became known across the youkai world for creating the Book of Friends. It is now in Natsume's possession, along with its power to call upon the written names of the youkai Reiko had defeated. \n\nWith no interest in its powers, Natsume decides to keep the book for the sake of his grandmother's memories and to protect it from scheming youkai. Therefore, he makes a deal with Madara: he will hand him the book once his time is up, and in turn, Madara will act as Natsume's unofficial bodyguard, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei.

This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji's body.\n\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji's assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\n\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin's desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Bee Train","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/5/Bee_Train"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":4015,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4015/School_Rumble_San_Gakki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/9553l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"School Rumble San Gakki"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"スクールランブル三学期"},{"type":"English","title":"School Rumble 3rd Semester"},{"type":"French","title":"School Rumble: Les Vacances d'été"}],"title":"School Rumble San Gakki","title_english":"School Rumble 3rd Semester","title_japanese":"スクールランブル三学期","title_synonyms":[],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":17,"month":7,"year":2008},"to":{"day":17,"month":9,"year":2008}},"string":"Jul 17, 2008 to Sep 17, 2008"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.29,"scored_by":35116,"rank":2694,"popularity":2681,"members":61916,"favorites":91,"synopsis":"A short 2 episodes attempt to conclude the series.

While making his way to the top, he slowly realizes that there is more to Battle Spirits than he ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":5165,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5165/Macross_25-shuunen_Kinen__All_That_VF_Macross_F_Version","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/11346l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Macross 25-shuunen Kinen: All That VF Macross F Version"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Macross 25th Anniversary Special Eizou: All That VF Macross F Version"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"マクロス 25周年記念 『All That VF -Version F-』"},{"type":"English","title":"Macross 25th Anniversary: All That VF Macross F Version"}],"title":"Macross 25-shuunen Kinen: All That VF Macross F Version","title_english":"Macross 25th Anniversary: All That VF Macross F Version","title_japanese":"マクロス 25周年記念 『All That VF -Version F-』","title_synonyms":["Macross 25th Anniversary Special Eizou: All That VF Macross F Version"],"type":"ONA","source":"Unknown","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":8,"year":2008},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 2008"},"duration":"2 min","rating":"PG-13 -

He tells his mother a lie that he placed 92nd, and he tears the answer sheets apart. On his way home from cram school, he accidently breaks the old bicycle that he is supposed to hand down to his little sister, Tamaki. This angers Tamaki. Furthermore, Tamaki accuses him of telling a lie, and he begins to think of her as a nuisance. One night, when he goes to a shrine to look for his missing dog, Chris, he encounters a young man named Yoyogi. Somehow, Yoyogi has the answer sheet marked as “92nd.\" Yoyogi proposes a trade, but threatens to return the answer sheet to its original owner unless he is given something Takane doesn't need.

Determined to recruit Tokuchi no matter what, Kojima places his own career on the line and defeats Tokuchi at his own specialty—One Outs.\n\nForced to become a Lycaon, Tokuchi soon finds himself at odds with the team's owner, Tsuneo Saikawa. After Saikawa refuses to give him a reasonable salary, Tokuchi proposes a special contract: pitching an out will earn him five million yen, but giving up a run will cost him fifty million. With every game having the potential to either make or break him, will Tokuchi be able to outwit those who stand in his way?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1791,"type":"anime","name":"D.N.

But when the fairy situation quickly spirals out of control and more layers of the mystery are revealed, Azaka must learn to work with Shiki in order to save her classmates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Includes claymation short which was shown before the movie in theaters.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":703,"type":"anime","name":"Notes","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/703/Notes"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"ufotable","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/43/ufotable"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4814,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4814/Junjou_Romantica_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/38417l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"_RbvvzcLmzQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RbvvzcLmzQ","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RbvvzcLmzQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_RbvvzcLmzQ/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_RbvvzcLmzQ/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_RbvvzcLmzQ/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_RbvvzcLmzQ/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_RbvvzcLmzQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Junjou Romantica 2"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Junjou Romantica Second Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Junjyou Romantica II"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"純情ロマンチカ2(に)"},{"type":"English","title":"Junjo Romantica 2"},{"type":"German","title":"Junjo Romantica 2"},{"type":"French","title":"Junjo Romantica 2"}],"title":"Junjou Romantica 2","title_english":"Junjo Romantica 2","title_japanese":"純情ロマンチカ2(に)","title_synonyms":["Junjou Romantica Second Season","Junjyou Romantica II"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2008-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":10,"year":2008},"to":{"day":28,"month":12,"year":2008}},"string":"Oct 12, 2008 to Dec 28, 2008"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

As part of their plan to lure out the Embryo, Easter hires Lulu de Morcerf, an aloof girl whose ruby necklace gives her the ability to convert Heart Eggs into Mystery Eggs.\n\nThese strange Mystery Eggs cannot be purified as easily as X Eggs, and they can force its owner to undergo a Character Transformation.

Shuutarou Kiba, a detective who happened to be on the train that hit the girl, takes up the investigation. However, he discovers that the mystery behind this case is intertwined with an intricate network of deceptions involving the Yuzuki family, especially its most prominent member, Youko Yuzuki—a famous actress and Kanako's sister.\n\nAlthough Kanako survives after surgery, her critical state prompts Youko to entrust a doctor, Dr. Koushirou Mimasaka, to take care of the girl in an ominous, box-shaped facility in the forest where she will receive experimental treatment. But soon after, on a night where Kiba and Yoriko visit Kanako, the convalescent suddenly vanished. Now searching for her whereabouts, the burden on Kiba dramatically grows when he learns about other gruesome discoveries: limbs of young girls in boxes. \n\nKiba is suggested by a colleague that the macabre findings are related not only to Kanako's disappearance but also to the truth behind her sister. As the investigation continues, the detective—enlisting the help of his partners Tatsumi Sekiguchi and Akihiko Chuuzenji—has to find a way to solve this series of crimes and find Kanako back.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":4163,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4163/Seto_no_Hanayome_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/22426l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Seto no Hanayome OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seto no Hanayome Jin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seto no Hanayome Gi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"瀬戸の花嫁 OVA"},{"type":"English","title":"My Bride is a Mermaid OVA"}],"title":"Seto no Hanayome OVA","title_english":"My Bride is a Mermaid OVA","title_japanese":"瀬戸の花嫁 OVA","title_synonyms":["Seto no Hanayome Jin","Seto no Hanayome Gi"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":2,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2008-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2009-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":11,"year":2008},"to":{"day":5,"month":1,"year":2009}},"string":"Nov 3, 2008 to Jan 5, 2009"},"duration":"29 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.82,"scored_by":28070,"rank":906,"popularity":2922,"members":52829,"favorites":29,"synopsis":"The Seto no Hanayome OVAs are new stand alone shorts with characters from the series and also two new ones.
