Looked down upon by their peers, the students in this class appear to have little hope in advancing their academic careers. That is, until the national government tasks them with eliminating the greatest threat to their planet: their new teacher. \n\nHaving already destroyed the moon, the octopus-like professor—dubbed \"Koro-sensei\"—has now threatened to destroy the Earth by March of the following year. In light of their mission, the students have found that killing him is easier said than done. Not only can Koro-sensei move at speeds of up to Mach 20, but he can also resist almost every earthly weapon. Ironically, he also proves to be one of the best teachers Class 3-E has ever had. Training the class to excel in both their studies as students and skills as assassins, Koro-sensei is confident that his students' ingenuity and indomitable will could return them to the main campus. \n\nThrough trial and error, Nagisa Shiota, as well as the other students of Class 3-E, must figure out Koro-sensei's weaknesses—and fast, for the very fate of the world depends upon it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":456,"type":"anime","name":"Lerche","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/456/Lerche"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":27899,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/27899/Tokyo_Ghoul_√A","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1889/123307l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"M2DObpz2174","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2DObpz2174","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2DObpz2174?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/M2DObpz2174/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/M2DObpz2174/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/M2DObpz2174/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/M2DObpz2174/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/M2DObpz2174/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tokyo Ghoul √A"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tokyo Ghoul Root A"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tokyo Ghoul 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Tokyo Ghoul Second Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"東京喰種√A"},{"type":"English","title":"Tokyo Ghoul √A"}],"title":"Tokyo Ghoul √A","title_english":"Tokyo Ghoul √A","title_japanese":"東京喰種√A","title_synonyms":["Tokyo Ghoul Root A","Tokyo Ghoul 2nd Season","Tokyo Ghoul Second Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2015-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":1,"year":2015},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":2015}},"string":"Jan 9, 2015 to Mar 27, 2015"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.02,"scored_by":1175686,"rank":4037,"popularity":46,"members":1736789,"favorites":10447,"synopsis":"Ken Kaneki has finally come to accept the monstrous, flesh-craving part of himself that he has feared and despised for so long.

In a panicked state, she plunges her blood saber into him only to realize that he's an immortal being. From then on, the two form an impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying to kill Akihito, in an effort to boost her own wavering confidence as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.\n\nAs the group's bond strengthens, however, so does the tenacity of the youmu around them. Their misadventures will soon turn into a fight for survival as the inevitable release of the most powerful youmu, Beyond the Boundary, approaches.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":30300,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30300/High_School_DxD_New__Oppai_Tsutsumimasu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/73605l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"High School DxD New: Oppai, Tsutsumimasu!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High School DxD New OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High School DxD New Episode 13"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハイスクールD×D NEW OVA おっぱい、包みます！"},{"type":"English","title":"High School DxD New OVA"}],"title":"High School DxD New: Oppai, Tsutsumimasu!","title_english":"High School DxD New OVA","title_japanese":"ハイスクールD×D NEW OVA おっぱい、包みます！","title_synonyms":["High School DxD New OVA","High School DxD New Episode 13"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":3,"year":2015},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 10, 2015"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"R+ -

Unfortunately, he was just fired from his last job and as a high school student, he doesn't have many other prospects.\n\nOne evening, he's attacked by a centipede monster on his way home. Shinichirou is saved by a mysterious girl with a bow and arrow, who he later discovers is Sakuya Shimazu, a beautiful student who attends his school. But when he later helps an injured girl, he discovers two things. First, the injured girl isn't human at all but rather a nekomata, a two-tailed demon cat. And second, Sakuya comes from a family of exorcists, who've protected humanity from rogue monsters and spirits for generations. Because Shinichirou was responsible for releasing the nekomata, Sakuya enlists his help in recapturing the demon, but that's just the beginning of Shinichirou's relationship with Sakuya. It turns out the Shimazu family needs a housekeeper and it just so happens that Shinichirou excels at cooking and likes to clean!

Only Gunzou Chihaya stands a chance against the Fleet of Fog as captain of the friendly Fog I-401 submarine Iona. As a result, Gunzou and his crew, known as Blue Steel, are tasked with a critical delivery mission by the Japanese government: they must deliver humanity's last hope against the Fleet of Fog, the Vibration Torpedo Warhead, through hostile waters to the United States for mass production.\n\nThough involved in the unsavory conflict, Blue Steel strives for nothing more than a peaceful resolution to it. As Iona undertakes the current mission and tasks beyond it, the crew upholds their values even in the face of harsh situations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Movie 1 -

Leading it off with an enormous stride, she will hop, step, and jump her way through, showing her unparalleled motivation and optimistic outlook. One, two, three—she'll shout out her excitement with the fire of a toy gun! \n\nMukiryoku Coup d'Etat\nAs an actor, Yuuto Akama is accustomed to playing different roles, and real life is just another one of these. He wears a practiced smile and a carefree attitude, but inside, a war is waging. A personality squashed and imprisoned... Yuuto puts down the coup d'état of his former self, all to maintain his perfect facade. But no matter how much time passes, the memories don't disappear, and he can never stop the flames of rebellion of his heart.\n\nUchouten Vivace\nWith a cheerful hop and skip, Himi Yasaka shows Eruna all the fun and excitement of the Calligraphy Club. It's a rhythmic and all-encompassing art; although calligraphy may take a bit of practice, anyone can do it. All you need is an ecstatic vivace!\n\nGarakuta Innocence\nNo matter what saturation, contrast, or hue, painter Kyouma Kuzuryuu cannot create a work that is good enough. Everything, including himself, always falls short. He lies to himself that this is what he always wanted, but in the end, he is still another piece of trash. Is there any salvation for the lonesome and self-deprecating Kyouma?\n\nIzayoi Seeing\nAsuhi Imizu has lived his life secluded from others. Gazing at the night sky through his telescope, he draws new constellations in his mind. However, like the sun after a rainstorm, Eruna brightens his life, helping him open up to others. Together, they view a 16-day-old moon; all the while, Asuhi is guided by her light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/80/Visual_Arts"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":30292,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30292/Saki_Achiga-hen__Episode_of_Side-A_-_Kuro_no_Tanjoubi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72495l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Saki Achiga-hen: Episode of Side-A -

The school is famous for its \"Shokugeki\"—intense cooking competitions between students often used to settle debates and arguments.

Once she seizes full power, Kobayashi aims to eradicate the Gaunas from the Lem system where former Sidonians have recently established a colony. Her ambition is justified by two breakthroughs: the development of highly effective, long-range anti-Gauna weapons, and the creation of Tsumugi Shiraui—the first human-Gauna chimera possessing great destructive power.\n\nFacing hostility toward chimeras and her uncertain large-scale military expedition, Kobayashi enlists the help of the new elite pilot Nagate Tanikaze. Due to his personal experiences with Shizuka Hoshijiro and Benisuzume's placenta, Tanikaze soon develops a close bond with Tsumugi. As the final battle against humanity's most formidable opponent approaches, Tanikaze tries to enjoy the last days of peace with his friend Izana Shinatose—all while Kobayashi secretly pursues the development of an experimental weapon that could very well lead to the complete destruction of Sidonia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"anime","name":"Starchild Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1023,"type":"anime","name":"Polygon Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1023/Polygon_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":15199,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15199/Code_Geass__Boukoku_no_Akito_3_-_Kagayaku_Mono_Ten_yori_Otsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"uvv2XJzdzBA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvv2XJzdzBA","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvv2XJzdzBA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 3 - Kagayaku Mono Ten yori Otsu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"コードギアス 亡国のアキト 第３章「輝くもの天より堕つ」"},{"type":"English","title":"Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls"},{"type":"German","title":"Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls"},{"type":"French","title":"Code Geass: Akito The Exiled - Ce Qui Brille Tombe du Ciel"}],"title":"Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 3 - Kagayaku Mono Ten yori Otsu","title_english":"Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls","title_japanese":"コードギアス 亡国のアキト 第３章「輝くもの天より堕つ」","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":2,"month":5,"year":2015},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 2, 2015"},"duration":"59 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.28,"scored_by":54102,"rank":2747,"popularity":1848,"members":112184,"favorites":104,"synopsis":"After discovering the face of their true enemy—someone who is related to Akito and responsible for the Geass placed upon him—W-0 attempts to return to their base at Castle Weisswolf.

This custom involves selecting worthy Eto-musume—celestial beings representing different animals—to become one of the members of the Chinese zodiac, or Eto-shin. However, since the first ETM12 two thousand years ago, the original batch of Eto-shin reigns with no one being able to replace them.\n\nNyaa-tan is a cat Eto-musume who aspires to become a member of the zodiac in the ongoing ETM12. Fulfilling her ambition requires her to secure 12 seals, one for each Eto-shin. To that end, she must win various types of battles using Sol/Lull—divine energy created by people's positive emotions. This task is not easy however, as her powers as an Eto-musume are far below the abilities of a single Eto-shin.

The place: Edo, now known as Tokyo.\n\nOne of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\n\nA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo's four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father's talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \"We're father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\"\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai's daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","background":"The film won the Jury Award at the 39th Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

Believing that grip racing is far superior to flashy drift racing, Nakazato is dead set on defeating the AE86 to prove that he is the better racer.\n\nThanks to Itsuki Takeuchi's hasty acceptance of the match on his behalf, Takumi is reluctant to get involved with the challenge and chooses not to race, stating that he is not a racer by any means. Overseeing the dilemma, Takumi's employer goads him into accepting. However, when Takumi returns home to get the AE86, he finds that his father has taken the car out for himself.

Though it only lasts for five seconds at a time, Yuu's mysterious power allowed him to cheat his way to the top of his class and  enter a prestigious high school, where he continues his dishonest acts.\n\nHis shenanigans are eventually stopped by Nao Tomori—the headstrong student council president from Hoshinoumi Academy—who sees through his deceit. Through coercion, Nao convinces Yuu to transfer to Hoshinoumi and join the student council. Hoshinoumi Academy is secretly an institution created for adolescents who possess supernatural abilities—with the student council serving as a means of locating those who abuse their powers.\n\nWith Yuu begrudgingly assisting in council affairs, the group sets out to find and protect new ability users from harm. However, as they further investigate the abilities, their findings entangle them in far more complicated matters than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":203,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/203/Visual_Arts"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

However, influenced by her deep belief in those tales, she is too naive and trusting, and her words soon shatter her family's bond when she inadvertently reveals her father's affair. Naruse is scarred for life after being blamed for her parent's divorce, and her regrets soon manifest into a fairy egg—a being who seals her mouth from speaking in order to protect everyone's happy ending.\n\nNow, even in high school, Naruse's speech remains locked by the fairy egg. Even trying to speak causes her stomach to twist. Though unable to convey her thoughts through words, she is unexpectedly chosen to perform in a musical alongside three other students: Takumi Sakagami, Natsuki Nitou, and Daiki Tasaki. Naruse makes her way to the club room to reject the daunting task, but changes her mind when she overhears Sakagami's beautiful singing.\n\nPerhaps the fairy egg \"curse\" does not apply to singing, and perhaps Sakagami is the fairy tale prince she has been seeking all along.

Strange Tales of Rampo: Game of Laplace) is inspired by the works of author Edogawa Rampo (a pseudonym for Tarou Hirai) and commemorates the 50th anniversary of his death in 1965.

However, all the new technologies are put into military use, beginning a new round of arms race. Vanguards, as the most significant achievement of the modern bioengineering and the most advanced weapon, are widely utilized in the race. Although vanguards are exceptionally combat-effective, their life expectancy is shortened by the nanomachines they use. Usually, most vanguards will retire from the army after a number of years in service.\n\nThe heroine Liuli has also consumed too much of her lifespan after executing missions for a long time. With only 380 days left in her life, Liuli receives a new mission, to rescue a hostage being held in a civilian facility. It is without doubt a difficult mission for a vanguard like Liuli, who only knows how to kill and battle. However, Liuli obediently decides to accept the mission in the end.\n\nDuring the mission, Liuli surprisingly finds that the man who holds the hostage was once a vanguard. The former vanguard Zhongrong Zhou cries and asks the government to hand over the son of Eden. As a vanguard, Liuli feels deep contempt against Zhou. To eliminate the scum of the vanguards, a battle between two vanguards begins...\n\n(Source: Official site, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1431,"type":"anime","name":"Yaoqi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1431/Yaoqi"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1325,"type":"anime","name":"Haoliners Animation League","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1325/Haoliners_Animation_League"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":31128,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31128/Arslan_Senki_TV__Tsuioku_no_Shou_-_Dakkan_no_Yaiba","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74848l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Arslan Senki (TV): Tsuioku no Shou -

In order to pursue his childhood dream, Saitama relentlessly trained for three years, losing all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is so powerful, he can defeat any enemy with just one punch. However, having no one capable of matching his strength has led Saitama to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.\n\nOne day, Saitama catches the attention of 19-year-old cyborg Genos, who witnesses his power and wishes to become Saitama's disciple. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society. Saitama, who is shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. Meeting new allies and taking on new foes, Saitama embarks on a new journey as a member of the Hero Association to experience the excitement of battle he once felt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Episodes 1 and 2 were previewed at a screening in Saitama city cultural center (small hall) on September 6, 2015.

As a minor and unknown deity, Yato continues to take odd jobs for five yen apiece in hopes of one day having millions of worshippers and his own grand shrine.

The powers of existing nations declined significantly, paving the way for a conglomerate called the Integrated Empire Foundation to assume control.

Enraged, Julis challenges him to a duel for intruding on her privacy. After said duel is voided by the student council president, Ayato reveals that he has no interest in Festas. Instead, he has enrolled in the academy to investigate the whereabouts of his missing elder sister.

The Anti-Magic Academy is a specialized school built to educate and train these Inquisitors, which splits its students into small squads in order to train them to work together. Among these talented squads is the 35th Test Platoon, also known as the \"Small Fry Platoon\" due to its low ranking and incompetent members. \n\nHowever, everything changes when Ouka Ootori, a powerful yet rebellious former Inquisitor, is forced into joining due to her tendency to break rules and committing a serious violation: the killing of a witch. Tempers flare upon her arrival, as she clashes with their clumsy captain Takeru Kusanagi and argues with the rest of the squad over her views on witches. This eclectic group has a long way to go if they wish to succeed and climb the ranks at the Anti-Magic Academy: they must first set aside their differences and come to work together as a team.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai adapts the first 5 novels of Touki Yanagimi's light novel series of the same name, as well as content from the Another Mission side story series.","season":"fall","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":963,"type":"anime","name":"MAGES.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2035,"type":"anime","name":"Heiwa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2035/Heiwa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":25099,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/25099/Ore_ga_Ojousama_Gakkou_ni_Shomin_Sample_Toshite_Gets♥Sareta_Ken","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76542l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"5cVaIS82_og","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cVaIS82_og","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cVaIS82_og?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5cVaIS82_og/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5cVaIS82_og/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5cVaIS82_og/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5cVaIS82_og/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5cVaIS82_og/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Gets♥Sareta Ken"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Story in Which I Was Kidnapped by a Young Lady's School to be a \"Sample of the Common People\""},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Ore ga Ojou-sama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Rachirareta Ken"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"俺がお嬢様学校に「庶民サンプル」としてゲッツされた件"},{"type":"English","title":"Shomin Sample"},{"type":"German","title":"Shomin Sample: Get's Shomin Sample"}],"title":"Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Gets♥Sareta Ken","title_english":"Shomin Sample","title_japanese":"俺がお嬢様学校に「庶民サンプル」としてゲッツされた件","title_synonyms":["Story in Which I Was Kidnapped by a Young Lady's School to be a \"Sample of the Common People\"","Ore ga Ojou-sama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Rachirareta Ken"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2015-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":10,"year":2015},"to":{"day":23,"month":12,"year":2015}},"string":"Oct 7, 2015 to Dec 23, 2015"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.68,"scored_by":131830,"rank":5626,"popularity":845,"members":274785,"favorites":446,"synopsis":"Kimito Kagurazaka is a commoner with a fetish for men's muscles—or at least that's the lie he must keep telling if he wants to keep himself out of trouble at the elite all-girls school, Seikain Academy.

But as Team Flare begins to move in search of the mysterious Z, the stories of Pokemon XY and Pokemon XY: Mega Evolution cross paths as Satoshi and his friends, along with Team Rocket, get caught up in a scheme that could put Kalos in great danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"18:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 18:55 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":499,"type":"anime","name":"The Pokemon Company International","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/499/The_Pokemon_Company_International"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]},{"mal_id":32215,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32215/High_School_DxD_BorN__Yomigaeranai_Fushichou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"High School DxD BorN: Yomigaeranai Fushichou"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High School DxD BorN OVA"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High School DxD BorN Episode 13"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"High School DxD Born OVA: The Pheoenix Doesn't Revive"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ハイスクールD×D BorN OVA 蘇らない不死鳥"},{"type":"English","title":"High School DxD Born OVA"},{"type":"French","title":"High School DxD BorN: Le phénix qui ne renaît pas de ses cendres"}],"title":"High School DxD BorN: Yomigaeranai Fushichou","title_english":"High School DxD Born OVA","title_japanese":"ハイスクールD×D BorN OVA 蘇らない不死鳥","title_synonyms":["High School DxD BorN OVA","High School DxD BorN Episode 13","High School DxD Born OVA: The Pheoenix Doesn't Revive"],"type":"OVA","source":"Light novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":12,"year":2015},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 9, 2015"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"R+ -

Unable to experience individual thoughts or emotions, the corpses are programmed by humans to act as laborers in various occupations.\n\nThis newfound technology, however, comes with a catch. Science may be able to restore the corpses' ability to move, yet it cannot return what every corpse loses at death: the soul. But Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who vanished shortly after his revolutionary work on corpse reanimation, is said to have revived the only corpse in possession of a soul.\n\nIn pursuit of this scientific knowledge, London medical student John Watson hopes to fulfill his promise to his late partner, Friday. After being scouted by a government agency, Watson is on a hunt to obtain Frankenstein's notes, which he believes hold the key to the secrets of the soul. During his search, Watson uncovers the harsh realities of the developing corpse technology and the price he must pay to advance his research.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the Platinum Grand Prize during the 2016 Future Film Festival, held in Italy.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":858,"type":"anime","name":"Wit Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":30991,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30991/Himouto_Umaru-chan_OVA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/76826l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Himouto!

The heightened development of medicine, nanomachine technology, and augmented reality promote this greater devotion to human health.\n\nSuffocated by the excessive kindness of Japanese society, high school student Miach Mihie decides to oppose the societal values she considers dehumanizing before the health implant surveillance system WatchMe activates itself the day she turns 18. Miach plans to kill herself with two of her friends, Tuan Kirie and Cian Reikadou. However, Cian betrays the pact in disagreement with Miach's intentions, allowing Tuan to survive her suicide attempt, unlike Miach, who is declared dead.\n\nThirteen years later, now a high-ranking inspector of Helix—an organization affiliated with WHO to monitor military conflicts—Tuan is sent back to Japan after her drug smuggling activities in the Niger warzone are discovered by senior Helix inspector Oscar Stauffenberg. On her first day back to the country she tried running away from, thousands of people simultaneously commit suicide. Tuan is now in charge of investigating this wave of mass suicide and exposing the terrorist organization behind the unprecedented attack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Harmony won the Platinum Grand Prize at the 2016 Future Film Festival held in Italy.

Facing opposition from other talented Star Teams, including the other four members of the Kao Council, Team Ootori must carve their own path as they aim to perform in the Ayanagi Festival. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1075,"type":"anime","name":"C-Station","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1075/C-Station"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Idols (Male)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/61/Idols_Male"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":70,"type":"anime","name":"Performing Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":32051,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32051/One_Piece__Adventure_of_Nebulandia","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/77050l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"qxMA4tvKD94","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMA4tvKD94","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxMA4tvKD94?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qxMA4tvKD94/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qxMA4tvKD94/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qxMA4tvKD94/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qxMA4tvKD94/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qxMA4tvKD94/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece: Adventure of Nebulandia"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"One Piece Special"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ワンピース～アドベンチャー オブ ネブランディア～"},{"type":"English","title":"One Piece: Adventure of Nebulandia"},{"type":"German","title":"One Piece: Abenteuer auf Nebulandia"}],"title":"One Piece: Adventure of Nebulandia","title_english":"One Piece: Adventure of Nebulandia","title_japanese":"ワンピース～アドベンチャー オブ ネブランディア～","title_synonyms":["One Piece Special"],"type":"Special","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":12,"year":2015},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 19, 2015"},"duration":"1 hr 46 min","rating":"PG-13 -

Whether or not it was only the strong who survived, the viability of living there required one not to be careless in making friends with the strong.\n\n(Source: Dark Translations)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1245,"type":"anime","name":"ZIZ Entertainment (ZIZ)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1245/ZIZ_Entertainment_ZIZ"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":405,"type":"anime","name":"T-Rex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/405/T-Rex"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":30419,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30419/Wake_Up_Girls_Beyond_the_Bottom","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76402l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"gqekzNSAHhs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqekzNSAHhs","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqekzNSAHhs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gqekzNSAHhs/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gqekzNSAHhs/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gqekzNSAHhs/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gqekzNSAHhs/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/gqekzNSAHhs/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Wake Up, Girls!

They were helpless to fight against them and resigned themselves to imminent death. At that time, an ultimate weapon which could create items out of imagination was discovered in a expansive cave under Japan, along with its young master Ryuusei who was in cryostasis. The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory.\n\nOne year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the ‘imagination embodiment device’. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force ‘Blade Briders’ was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.\n\n(Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1369,"type":"anime","name":"G-Lam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1369/G-Lam"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":30649,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30649/Shin_Atashinchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76046l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Shin Atashin'chi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shin Atashinchi"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"新あたしンち"},{"type":"German","title":"Shin Atashinchi"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Shin Atashinchi"},{"type":"French","title":"Shin Atashinchi"}],"title":"Shin Atashin'chi","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"新あたしンち","title_synonyms":["Shin Atashinchi"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2016-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":10,"year":2015},"to":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2016}},"string":"Oct 6, 2015 to Apr 5, 2016"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.26,"scored_by":1586,"rank":2860,"popularity":9004,"members":3777,"favorites":21,"synopsis":"Outrageous misadventures of an almost normal family with a housewife, her husband, and their two kids Yuusuke and Mikan.

As an international co-production, three Nigerian animators traveled to Japan to animate two sequences. Makoto Tezuka spearheaded the international focus, which was partly made as a response to declining birth rates in Japan and in hopes of receiving an endorsement from the Cool Japan initiative. Described as \"edutainment,\" Robot Atom ran in English on Channels TV's children's block of programming between March 22, 2014 and April 26, 2014.

And to battle Roach King, Jen and the three have to find and unite the rest of the original Zodiac -- Rat, Cow, Tiger, Rabbit, Snake, Monkey, Rooster, and Dog.\n\nTogether, they embark on a journey that though dangerous, turns out to be rewardingly heartwarming. \n\n(Source: Animation World Network)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":53069,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53069/Afternoon_Class","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1645/128051l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Afternoon Class"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"애프터눈 클래스"},{"type":"English","title":"Afternoon Class"}],"title":"Afternoon Class","title_english":"Afternoon Class","title_japanese":"애프터눈 클래스","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2015-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":31,"month":10,"year":2015},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 31, 2015"},"duration":"3 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.52,"scored_by":122,"rank":6498,"popularity":18868,"members":234,"favorites":0,"synopsis":"A student is trying to stay awake in an afternoon class.\n\n(Source: IMDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":36161,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36161/Annyeong_Jeonwoochi_Dosoolrobotdaegyeoljeon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/87371l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Annyeong, Jeonwoochi!
