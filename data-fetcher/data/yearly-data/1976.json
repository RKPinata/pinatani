The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1976,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":34227,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34227/Belle_to_Kaijuu_Ouji","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82359l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Belle to Kaijuu Ouji"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Beauty and the Beast"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"La Belle et la Bête"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ベルとかいじゅう王子"}],"title":"Belle to Kaijuu Ouji","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ベルとかいじゅう王子","title_synonyms":["Beauty and the Beast","La Belle et la Bête"],"type":"Movie","source":"Book","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1976-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1976},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1976"},"duration":"19 min","rating":"G -

Throughout the story, battles are waged between the kingdoms of Shang and Zhou, with both sides calling upon various supernatural beings – deities, immortals, demons, spirits, and humans with magical abilities – to aid them in the war. Yuanshi Tianzun bestows upon Jiang Ziya the Fengshen Bang, a list that empowers him to invest the gods of Heaven. The heroes of Zhou and some of their fallen enemies from Shang are eventually endowed with heavenly ranking and essentially elevated to their roles as gods, hence the title of the novel.\n\n(Source: Wiki)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":29791,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/29791/Are_wa_Dare","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/71578l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Are wa Dare?"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"あれはだれ?"},{"type":"English","title":"Who's That?"}],"title":"Are wa Dare?","title_english":"Who's That?","title_japanese":"あれはだれ?","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1976-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1976},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1976"},"duration":"21 min","rating":"G -

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet’s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality.
