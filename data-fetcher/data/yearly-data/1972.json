He teamed up with Takahata for the later episodes of the 1971-72 Lupin III series, but Yuki's Sun marked his first time solely in the captain's seat.\n\nYuki's Sun was based upon a popular shoujo manga (girls' comic) by Tetsuya Chiba which was serialized in 1963. It involves a 10-year-old orphan girl who is adopted into a family. The storyline is somewhat complex, and seems to play out like grand melodrama. Chiba's stories were more sophisticated and grown-up than, say, Osamu Tezuka, who of course was the godfather of postwar Japanese manga.\n\n(Source: TheGhibliBlog)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1846,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Movie","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1846/Tokyo_Movie"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":7025,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7025/Kiseichuu_no_Ichiya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/64693l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kiseichuu no Ichiya"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Midnight Parasites"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"寄生虫の一夜"}],"title":"Kiseichuu no Ichiya","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"寄生虫の一夜","title_synonyms":["The Midnight Parasites"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1972-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1972},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1972"},"duration":"9 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":5.05,"scored_by":1433,"rank":12442,"popularity":9960,"members":2699,"favorites":9,"synopsis":"Short experimental animation from 1972 by Yoji Kuri.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8235,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8235/Muumin_1972","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/47155l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Muumin (1972)"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shin Muumin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"New Moomin"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ムーミン"}],"title":"Muumin (1972)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ムーミン","title_synonyms":["Shin Muumin","New Moomin"],"type":"TV","source":"Book","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1972-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1972-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":9,"month":1,"year":1972},"to":{"day":31,"month":12,"year":1972}},"string":"Jan 9, 1972 to Dec 31, 1972"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.54,"scored_by":839,"rank":6428,"popularity":10007,"members":2663,"favorites":7,"synopsis":"A remake of the 1969-70 Moomin series.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1972,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":841,"type":"anime","name":"Saban Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/841/Saban_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":7171,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7171/Oni","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1790/135914l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Oni"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Demon"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"鬼"}],"title":"Oni","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"鬼","title_synonyms":["The Demon"],"type":"Movie","source":"Other","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1972-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":1,"year":1972},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"1972"},"duration":"7 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.04,"scored_by":1004,"rank":9089,"popularity":10850,"members":2049,"favorites":3,"synopsis":"One morning, two brothers living in a hut with their mother set out for the mountains to set traps for deer.

He was famous for his violent temper and now he is lashing out at his three gunmen, who had been ordered to bring back Pero, but had returned empty-handed. Pero, a former subject of the angry King, had lived in Cat Country once but he had dared to save a mouse from death. Now, as everyone knows, the mouse is the mortal enemy of all cats, so the King orders his three gunmen to go to the ends of the earth, if necessary, to find Pero. Pero is a happy-go-lucky sort of feline and very hip for a cat. \n\nFleeing from the wrath of the King, he decides to seek his fortune in the wild and wooly west. On the way, he encounters the King’s gunmen hot on his trail but he foils them and blithely goes on his way. On the stagecoach to Go Go Town, he meets Annie, a pretty girl who is returning after finishing her education in the East, and Jimmy, a boy with sleepy eyes and slow movements. \n\nThey are attacked suddenly by holdups who are after the new sheriff but since he does not seem to be on the coach, they ride off. Sad news awaits Annie in town. Her father had been killed by the Big Bad Boss for finding out about the bogus money he was making to get rich fast. The Big Bad Boss also kills each new sheriff who arrives to keep law and order in town. He is determined to keep the whole place under his thumb. The Big Bad Boss tries to scare Annie into leaving town but she is her father’s daughter and cannot be frightened away by threats. With the help of Pero and Jimmy, she opens a restaurant in the building her father owned. Once again, Pero happens to save a little Indian mouse caught in a trap. \n\nThe little mouse’s father, the Chieftain of the Indian mice, promises to help Pero and Annie. The sleepy-eyed Jimmy is really the new sheriff. They all join forces and expose the Big Boss’ villainy and his secret bogus money factory.

But an international criminal group, Gallactor, tries to achieve world domination by taking control of the ISO. Gallactor was created by a mysterious being from outer space known as Generalissimo X, who gives orders through its chief commander on Earth, the masked Berg Katse. To fight Gallactor and its robot monsters, the ISO's Dr. Nambu enlists five brave youths into a combat squad called Gatchaman,the Science Commandos. Special scientific powers and dramatic birdlike costumes make the Gatchaman Squad a match for Gallactor, wherever on Earth it may strike. Ken (the Eagle) is the wise leader, assisted by sometimes-foolhardy Joe (the Condor), pretty Jun (the Swan), eager little Jinpei (the Swallow), and strong Ryu (the Horned Owl). Each has individual scientific weapons, but their main power lies in their aircraft, the Phoenix, which can transform itself into a fiery arrow capable of piercing the most massive threats. GATCHAMAN is a series of dynamic action and tension as Ken, Joe, Jun, Jinpei, and Ryu hold themselves in constant readiness to meet each new threat by Gallactor to conquer the world.\n\n(Source: Official Site)\n\nAbout Battle of the Planets (U.S.)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1972,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5618,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5618/Dokonjou_Gaeru","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1637/134645l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"01t0n8es8DE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01t0n8es8DE","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/01t0n8es8DE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/01t0n8es8DE/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/01t0n8es8DE/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/01t0n8es8DE/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/01t0n8es8DE/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/01t0n8es8DE/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dokonjou Gaeru"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Frog With Guts!"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dokonjo Gaeru"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Gutsy Frog"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ど根性ガエル"}],"title":"Dokonjou Gaeru","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ど根性ガエル","title_synonyms":["Frog With Guts!","Dokonjo Gaeru","The Gutsy Frog"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":103,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1972-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1974-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":10,"year":1972},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":1974}},"string":"Oct 7, 1972 to Sep 28, 1974"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.71,"scored_by":421,"rank":5513,"popularity":11193,"members":1807,"favorites":7,"synopsis":"When Hiroshi was fighting against his rival Gorillaimo, he stumbled over a stone and fell on to a frog.
